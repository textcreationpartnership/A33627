            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

How much rather then ſhould men forbear to cenſure thoſe and their Works which have had the greateſt allowance and atteſtation a Senate could give, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce and reſt ſatisfied in that judgement? Such reſpect and allowance hath been given to the learned Works of the late Honourable and Venerable Chiefe Juſtice, Sir EDWARD COKE, whoſe Perſon in his life time was reverenced as an Oracle, and his Works (ſince his deceaſe) cyted as Authentick Authorities, even by the Reverend Judges themſelves. The acceptance his Books (already extant) have found with all knowing Perſons, hath given me the confidence to commend to the publick view ſome Remains of his, under his owne hand-writing, which have not yet appeared to the World, yet (like true and genuine Eaglets) are well able to behold and bear the light: They are of the ſame Piece and Woofe with his former Works, and in reſpect of their owne native worth, and the reference they bear to their Author, cannot
<pb facs="tcp:98298:3"/> be too highly valued: Though, in reſpect of their quantity and number, the Reports are but few; yet, as the skilfull Jeweller will not loſe ſo much as the very filings of rich and precious mettals; and the very fragments were commanded to be kept where a Miracle had been wrought, <hi>Propter miraculi claritatem &amp; evidentiam:</hi> So theſe ſmall parcels, being part of thoſe vaſt and immenſe labours of their Author, great almoſt to a Miracle (if I may be allowed the compariſon:) were there no other uſe to be made of them (as there is very much, for they manifeſt and declare to the Reader many ſecret and abſtruſe points in Law, not ordinarily to be met with in other Books ſo fully and amply related) deſerve a publication, and to be preſerved in the reſpects and memories of Learned men, and eſpecially the Profeſſors of the Law; and to that end they are now brought to light and publiſhed. If any ſhould doubt of the truth of theſe Reports of Sir EDWARD COKE, they may ſee the originall Manuſcript in French, written with his own hand, at <hi>Henry Twyfords</hi> Shop in <hi>Vine-Court Middle Temple.</hi>

Stallon,</hi> then and there utterly denied and refuſed, and as yet doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe.

And in this Caſe theſe points were reſolved by <hi>Coke</hi> chief Iuſtice, <hi>VValmeſly, VVarberton, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> Iuſtices, 1. And principally, If the Fine aſſeſſed had been reaſonable, yet the Lords ought to have ſet a certain time and place when the ſame ſhould be paid, becauſe the ſame ſtands upon a point of forfeiture: As if a man bargains and aſſures Land to one and his heirs, upon condition that if he pay to the Bargaines or his heirs ten pounds at ſuch apiace, that he and his heirs ſhall re-enter: In that caſe becauſe no time is limited, the Bargainor ought to give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Bargaines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> when he will tender the money, and he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tender it when he pleaſeth, and with that agrees, 19 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 354. For a man ſhall not loſe his Land, unleſſe an expreſſe default be in him; and the Bargaineein ſuch Caſe is not tied to ſtay alwaies in the place, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So in the Caſeat Bar, the Copyholder is not tied to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry his Fine alwaies with him, when he is at Church, or at Plow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And although that the Rejoynder is, that the Plaintiff refuſed to pay the Fine, ſo he might well do, when the requeſt is not lawfull nor rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, for in all caſes when the requeſt is not lawfull nor reaſonable, the party may without prejudice deny the payment. And he who is to pay a great Fine as a 100 <hi>l.</hi> or more, it is not reaſonable that he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry it alwaies with him in his Pocket, and preſently the Copyholder was not bound to it, becauſe that the Fine was uncertain &amp; arbitrable, as it was reſolved in <hi>Hulbarts</hi> Caſe in the fourth part of my Reports, amongſt the Copyhold Caſes. 2. It was reſolved, that although the Fine be incertain and arbitrable, yet it ought to be <hi>ſecundum arbitri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um boni viri:</hi> And it ought to be reaſonable and not exceſſive, for all exceſſiveneſſe is abhorred in Law, <hi>Exceſſus in re qualibet jure repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batur Communi;</hi> For the Common Law forbids any exceſſive diſtreſſe, as it appeareth in 41 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 26.

               <p>It was reſolved, That the ſaid Fine in the Caſe at the Bar was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable, <hi>viz.</hi> To demand for a Cottage and an acre of Paſture, five pounds, ſix ſhillings eight pence, for the Admittance of a Copyhol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in Fee-ſimple upon a Surrender made; For this is not like to a voluntary Grant, as when the Copyholder hath but an Eſtate for life, and dieth, Or if he hath an Eſtate in Fee-ſimple, and committeth Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony, there <hi>Arbitrio Dom. res eſtimari debet;</hi> but when the Lord is compellable to admit him to whoſe uſe the Surrender is, And when <hi>Ceſtui que uſe</hi> is admitted, he ſhall be in by him who made the Surren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and the Lord is but an Inſtrument to preſent the ſame: And therefore in ſuch Caſe, the value of two years for ſuch an Admittance is unreaſonable, eſpecially when the value of the Cottage and one acre of Paſture is a Rack, at fifty three ſhillings by the year.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It was reſolved, That the Surjoynder is no more then what the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:98298:5"/> Law ſaith. For in this Caſe in the Iudgment of the Law, the Fine is unreaſonable; and therefore the ſame is but <hi>ex abundanti:</hi> and now the Court ought to judge upon the whole ſpeciall matter; And for the Cauſes aforeſaid, Iudgment was given for the Plaintiff.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Coke</hi> chief Iuſtice ſaid in this Caſe, That where the uſage of the Court of Admiralty is to amerce the Defendant for his default by his diſcretion, as it appeareth in 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. That if the Amerciament be outrageous and exceſſive, the ſame ſhall not bind the party, and if it be exceſſive or not, it ſhall be determined in the Court in which the Action ſhall be brought, for the levying of it: And the Writ of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count is againſt the Bayliff, or Guardian, <hi>Quod reddat ei rationa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilem Computum de exitibus Manerii.</hi> And the Law requireth a thing which is reaſonable, and no exceſſe or extremity in any thing.</p>

               <p n="1">1. That all Acts of Parliament made by the King, Lords, and Commons of Parliament are parcell of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and therefore ſhall be expounded by the Iudges of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and not by the Civilians and Commoniſts, although the Acts concern Eccleſiaſticall and Spirituall Iuriſdiction; And therefore the Act of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. by which in effect it is enacted, <hi>Quod nullus teneat, do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat, informet, &amp;c. clam, vel publice aliquam nefandam opinionem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trariam ſidei Catholicae ſeu determinationi Eccleſiae ſacro-ſanctae, nec de hujuſmodi ſecta, &amp; nephandis Doctrinis Conventiculas faciat:</hi> And that in ſuch Caſes, the <hi>Dioceſſan</hi> might arreſt and impriſon ſuch Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fender, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> commanded one to be impriſoned, becauſe that the Plaintiff ſaid that he ought not to pay his Tithes to his Curat: and the party ſo impriſoned brought an Action of Falſe Impriſonment againſt thoſe who arreſted him by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment of the Biſhop; and there the matter is well argued, What words are within the ſaid Statute, and what without the Statute: So upon the ſame Statute it was reſolved in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. in <hi>Keyſars</hi> caſe in the

               <p n="2">2. It was reſolved by <hi>Coke</hi> chief Iuſtice, <hi>Warberton, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> Iuſtices, That the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> is reſtrained by the Act of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9. to cite any one out of his own Dioceſſe, or his Peculiar Iuriſdiction, although that he holdeth his Court of <hi>Arches</hi> within <hi>London.</hi> And firſt it was objected,</p>
               <p>That the Title of the Act is; <hi>An Act that no perſon ſhall be cited out of the Dioceſs where he or ſhe dwelleth, except in certain Caſes:</hi> And here the Archbiſhop doth not cite the ſaid Party dwelling in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> out of the Dioceſſe of <hi>London,</hi> for he holdeth his Court of <hi>Arches</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>London.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Preamble of the Act is, Where a great number of the Kings Subjects dwelling in divers Dioceſſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here he doth not dwell in divers Dioceſſes.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Far out of the Dioceſſe where ſuch men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> dwell, and here he doth not dwell far out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The body of the Act is, No manner of perſon ſhall be cited be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any Ordinance, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Dioceſſe or peculiar Iuriſdiction where the perſon ſhall be inhabiting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And here he was not cited out of the Dioces of <hi>London.</hi> To which it was anſwered and reſolved, That the ſame was prohibited by the ſaid Act for divers Cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. As to all the ſaid Objections, One anſwer makes an end of them all: For <hi>Dioceſis dicitur diſtinctio, vel diviſio, ſive gubernatio, quae di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſa, &amp; diverſa eſt ab Eccleſia alterius Epiſcopatus, &amp; Commiſſa Guber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natio in unius;</hi> and is derived <hi>a Di<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> quod eſt duo &amp; electio, id eſt, ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratio, quia ſeperat duas Juriſdictiones:</hi> So Dioces ſignifies the Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of one Ordinary ſeperated and divided from others; And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath a peculiar Iuriſdiction in <hi>Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don,</hi> exempt out of the Dioces or Iuriſdiction of the Ordinary or Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>London:</hi> For that cauſe it is fitly ſaid, in the Title, <hi>Peramble,</hi> and body of the Act, That when the Archbiſhop ſitting in his exempt Peculiar in <hi>London,</hi> cites one dwelling in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> he cites him out of the Dioces or Iuriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>London, ergo</hi> he is cited out of the Dioces: And in the clauſe of the penalty of ten pounds, It is ſaid, out of the Dioces, or other Iuriſdiction where the party dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth, which agreeth with the ſignification of Dioces before. And as to the words, <hi>Far off, &amp;c.</hi> they were put in the Preamble, to ſhew, the great miſchief which was before the Act: As the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 33. in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> it is Diſſeiſins with ſtrength; and the body
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:98298:6"/> of the Act ſaith, <hi>ſuch Diſſeiſor,</hi> yet the ſame extendeth to all Diſſeiſors, but Diſſeiſin with force was the greateſt miſchief, as it is holden in 4. and 5 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 219. So the Preamble of the Statute of <hi>Weſt.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. is, Heirs in Ward, and the body of the Act is, <hi>Hujuſmodi praeſentat.</hi> as it is adjudged in 44 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 18. That an Infant who hath an Advowſon by diſcent and is out of Ward, ſhall be within the remedy of the ſaid Act, but the Frauds of the Guardians was the greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief. So the Preamble of the Act of 21 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 15. which gives fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſifying of Recoveries, recites in the <hi>Preamble,</hi> That divers Leſſees have paid divers great Incomes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Be it enacted, That all ſuch Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet the ſame extends to all Termors: and yet all theſe Caſes are ſtronger then the Caſe at Bar, for there that word <hi>(ſuch)</hi> in the body of the Act referreth the ſame to the <hi>Preamble,</hi> which is not in our Caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The body of the Act is, No manner of perſon ſhall be henceforth cited before any Ordinary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> out of the Dioces or peculiar Iuriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction where the perſon ſhall be dwelling: And if he ſhall not be cited out of the Peculiar before any Ordinary a <hi>Fortiori,</hi> the Court of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches which ſits in a Peculiar, ſhal not cite others out of another Dioces: And theſe words, <hi>Out of the Dioces,</hi> are to be meant out of the Dioces or Iuriſdiction of the Ordinary, where he dwelleth; but the exempt Peculiar of the Archbiſhop is out of the Iuriſdiction of the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> as S. <hi>Martins,</hi> and other places in <hi>London,</hi> are not part of <hi>London,</hi> although they are within the circumference of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is to be obſerved, That the Preamble reciting of the great miſchief, recites expreſly, That the Subjects were called by compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary proces to appear in the Arches, Audience, and other high Courts of the Archbiſhoprick of this Realm; So as the intention of the ſaid Act was to reduce the Archbiſhop to his proper Dioces or peculiar Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, unleſſe it were in five Caſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For any Spirituall Offence or cauſe committed, or omitted con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the right and duty by the Biſhop, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which word <hi>(omitted)</hi> proves that there ought to be a default in the Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Except it be in caſe of Appeal and other lawfull cauſe wherein the party ſhall find himſelfe greived by the Ordinary after the matter or cauſe there firſt begun; <hi>ergo</hi> the ſame ought to be firſt begun before the Ordinary.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In caſe that the Biſhop of the Dioces, or other immediate Iudge or Ordinary dare not, or will not convent the party to be ſued before him, where the Ordinary is called the immediate Iudge, as in truth he is; and the Archbiſhop unleſſe it be in his own Dioces (theſe ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall Caſes excepted) mediate Iudge, <hi>ſcil.</hi> by Appeal, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Or in caſe that the Biſhop of the Dioces, or the Iudge of the place within whoſe Iuriſdiction, or before whom the Suit by this Act ſhould be begun and proſecuted be party directly or indirectly to the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or cauſe of the ſame ſuit; Which clauſe in expreſſe words is a full expoſition of the body of the Act, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That every ſuit (others then thoſe which are expreſſed) ought to be begun and proſecuted, before the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of the Dioces, or other Iudge of the ſame place.</p>
               <p n="5">5. In caſe that any Biſhop or any inferiour Iudge having under him Iuriſdiction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> make requeſt or inſtance to the Archbiſhop, Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, or other inferiour Ordinary or Iudge, and that to be done in ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes only where the Law Civill or Common doth affirm, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which it fully appeareth, That the Act intendeth, That every Ordinary and
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:98298:6"/> Eccleſiaſticall Iudge ſhould have the Conuſance of Cauſes within their Iuriſdiction, without any Concurrent Authority or Suit by way of prevention: And by this, the Subject hath great benefit as well by ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of travell and charges to have Iuſtice in his place of habitation, as to be judged where he and the matter is beſt known; As alſo that he ſhall have many Appeals as his Adverſary in the higheſt Court at the firſt. Alſo there are two <hi>Proviſoes</hi> which explains it alſo, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That it ſhall be lawfull to every Archbiſhop to cite any perſon inhabiting in any Biſhops Dioceſſe within his Province, for matter of Hereſie, (which were a vain <hi>Proviſo,</hi> If the Act did not extend to the Archbiſhop: But by that ſpeciall <hi>Proviſo</hi> for Hereſie, it appeareth, that, for all cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes not excepted, is prohibited by the Act) Then the words of the <hi>Proviſo</hi> go further, If the Biſhop or other Ordinary immediatly hereunto con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, or if the ſame Biſhop or other immediate Ordinary or Iudge do not his duty in puniſhment of the ſame; which words immediatly and immediate expound the intent of the makers of the Act.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There is a ſaving for the Archbiſhop the calling any perſon out of the Dioces where he ſhall be dwelling to the probate of any Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; which <hi>Proviſo</hi> ſhould be alſo in vain, if the Archbiſhop not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding that Act ſhould have concurrent Authority with every Ordinary through his whole Province: Wherefore it was concluded that the Archbiſhop out of his Dioces, unleſſe in the Caſes excepted, is prohibited by the Act of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. to cite any man out of any other Dioces. And in truth the Act of 23. of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, is but a Law declaratory of the ancient Canons, and of the true expoſition of them: <note place="margin">
                     <hi>The Act of</hi> 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>is a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the old Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non Law.</hi>
                  </note> And that appeareth by the Canon: <hi>Cap. Romana in ſexto de Appella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionibus,</hi> and <hi>Cap. de Competenti in ſexto.</hi> And the ſaid Act is ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded by all the Clergy of <hi>England,</hi> at a Convocation in <hi>London, An.</hi> 1 <hi>Jac.

Where it is decreed, ordained, and declared, That none ſhould be cited to the Arches, or Audience, but the Inhabitants within the Archbiſhops Dioces, or Peculiar, other then in ſuch particular Caſes only as are expreſly excepted and reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in and by a Statute, <hi>Anno</hi> 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 9.

And although the Archbiſhoprick of <hi>Canterbury</hi> was then void, yet the Guardian of the Spiritualties was there, and the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> that now is, and then Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> was by Letters Patents, Preſident of the ſaid Councell in the place of the Archbiſhop then deceaſed: And the King gave his royall Aſſent to the ſame, and the ſaid Canon is of as full force as if the ſaid late Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> had been then alive.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That Mr. <hi>John Walton</hi> hath been many yeares trained up in Learning in the Vniverſity of <hi>Oxford<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and there worthily admitted to ſeverall degrees of Schools, and deſervedly took upon him the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Doctor of Phyſick.</p>

               <p n="1">1. Becauſe that the matter and perſons are Temporall.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly, Becauſe it is for Defamation, which if any ſuch ſhall be for the ſame, it ought to begin before the Ordinary, becauſe it is not ſuch an Enormous Offence, which is to be determined by the high Commiſſioners: And for the ſame reaſon Suit doth not lye before them, for calling the Doctor Cuckould, as it was objected in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Article: And it was ſaid, that the high Commiſſioners ought to incur the danger of Premunire.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was reſolved, That the Eccleſiaſticall Iudge cannot examine any man upon his Oath, upon the intention and thought of his Heart, for <hi>Cogitationis penam nemo emoret.</hi> And in caſes where a man is to be examined upon his Oath, he ought to be examined upon Acts or words, and not of the intention and thought of his heart; and if every man ſhould be examined upon his Oath, what opinion he holdeth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning any point of Religion, he is not bound to anſwer the ſame, for in time of danger, <hi>Quis modo tutus erit,</hi> if every one ſhould be exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned of his thoughts. And ſo long as a man doth not offend neither in act nor in word any Law eſtabliſhed, there is no reaſon that he ſhould be examined upon his thought or Cogitation: For as it hath been ſaid in the Proverb, <hi>Thought is free;</hi> And therefore for the ſixth and ſeventh Articles, they were reſolved as well for the matter as for the form in of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering to examine the Defendant upon his Oath, of his intention and meaning, were ſuch, to which the Defendant was not to be compelled to anſwer: <hi>Ergo,</hi> It was reſolved, that as to the Article, he might juſtifie the ſame, becauſe as it appeareth upon his own ſhewing, that
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:98298:8"/> the Doctor was ſentenced in the <hi>Star-Chamber:</hi> Alſo the Libell is mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter meer Temporall, and if it were meer Spirituall ſuch a Defama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is not examinable before the high Commiſſioners.</p>
               <p>As to the laſt Article, It appeareth now by the Iudgment of this Court, that he might well juſtifie the ſaid words: Alſo the high Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhall not have Conuſance of any Scandall to themſelves for <note place="margin">

And it was ſaid, That the Trade of a Brewer is not any Art, Myſtery, or manuall Occupation within the ſaid Branch, becauſe the ſame is eaſily and preſently learned, and he
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:98298:9"/> needs not to have ſeven years Apprentiſhip to be inſtructed in the ſame, for every Huſwife in the Country can do the ſame: and the Act of <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the eighth is, That a Brewer is not a Handycraft Artificer.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was moved, That the ſaid Averment was not ſufficient, for the Averment ought to be as generall as the exception in the Statute is <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> That the Defendant did not uſe any Art, Myſtery, or Occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupation at the time of the making of the ſame Act, for by this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence if any Art, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> then as a Taylor, Carpenter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he may now ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe any other Art whatſoever.</p>
               <p>As unto the firſt, It was reſolved, That the Trade of a Brewer <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> to hold a common Brewhouſe, to ſell Beer or Ale to another, is an Art and Myſtery within the ſaid Act,; for in the beginning of the Act, It is enacted, That no perſon ſhall be retained for leſſe time then a whole year in any of the Services, Crafts, Myſteries, or Arts of Cloathing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bakers, Brewers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Cooks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So as by the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſame Parliament, The Trade of a Brewer is an Art and Myſtery; which words are in the ſaid Branch upon which the ſaid Information is grounded. Alſo becauſe that every Huſwife brews for her private uſe; ſo alſo ſhe bakes, and dreſſeth Meat: And yet none can hold a common Bakehouſe, or a Cooks Shop to ſell to others, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe that he hath been an Apprentice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for they are expreſly named alſo in the Act as Arts and Myſteries: And the Act of 22 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. is explained, That a Brewer, Baker, Surgeon, and Scrivener Alien, are not handycrafts mentioned within certain penall Lawes: But the ſame doth not prove, but that they are Arts or Myſterys, for Art or Myſtery is more generall then Handycrafts, for the ſame is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained to Manufactures.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Point, It was reſolved, That the intention of the Act was, That none ſhould take upon him any <hi>Art,</hi> but he who hath skill or knowledge in the ſame: And therefore the Statute intendeth, That he who uſeth any Art or Myſtery at the time of the Act, might uſe the ſame Art or Myſtery; for <hi>Quod quiſque norit in hoc ſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceat:</hi> And the words of the Act are, <hi>As now do lawfully uſe, &amp;c.</hi> And it was ſaid, That it was very neceſſary, that Brewers ſhould have knowledge and skill in brewing good and wholſome Beer and Ale, for that the ſame doth greatly conduce to mens healths: And ſo the firſt Iudgment was affirmed.</p>

                  <hi>SHerley</hi> Serjeant moved to have a Prohibition, becauſe that a perſon <note place="margin">Tithes.</note> ſued to have Tithes of <hi>Silva Cedua</hi> under twenty years growth in the Weild of <hi>Kent;</hi> where, by the Cuſtome of it which is a great part of the County, Tithes of any Wood was never paid. And if ſuch a Cuſtome <hi>in non Decimando</hi> for all Lay people within the ſaid Weild, were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full or not was the queſtion; And to have a Prohibition it was ſaid, That although one particular man ſhall not preſcribe <hi>in non deciman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do,</hi> yet ſuch a generall Cuſtome within a great Country might well be, as in 43 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 32. and 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Cuſtome</hi> 15. It was preſented in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> That an Abbot had purchaſed Tenements after the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Abbot came and ſaid, That he was Lord of the
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:98298:9"/> Town, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the cuſtome of the Town was, That when the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ceſſeth for two years, that the Lord might enter untill agreement be made for the Arrerages; And that he who held theſe Tenements was his Tenant, and ceſſed for two years, and he entred: and the Rule of the Court is, Becauſe it was an uſage only in that Town, and not in the Towns, that is, in the Country adjoyning; he was put to anſwer: So as by the ſame it appeareth, that a Cuſtome was not good in a particular Town, which perhaps might be good and of force in a Country, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> See 40 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 21. and 27, 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 2. A Cuſtome with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a Town, that an Infant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might alien, is not good; But yet ſuch a Cuſtome within <hi>Kent</hi> hath often times been adjudged to be good. See 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 26. <hi>b.</hi> 16 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Preſcription</hi> 53. <hi>Dyer</hi> 363. 22 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 14. 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 15. and 45 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 8. See <hi>Doctor and Student lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. A partciular Country may preſcribe to pay no Tithes for Corn, Hay, and other things, but that is with this caution, ſo as the Miniſter hath ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent portion beſides to maintain him, to celebrate the Divine Service: And <hi>fol.</hi> 172. It is holden, That where Tithes have not been paid of under-woods under twenty years growth, that no Tithes ſhall be paid for the ſame, becauſe that they do not renew nor increaſe from yeare to year, ſo as they are not due to the Parſon but by Cuſtome. And he ſaith <hi>fol.</hi> 174. That ſuch a Cuſtome of a whole Country, that no Tithes of a Lordſhip ſhall be paid, is good; and it is to be obſerved, that in all Libells for Tithes of Woods, they alledge a preſcription to have Tithes of them: But the Court would adviſe, whether ſuch a Cuſtome for a Town or a Country ſhould be good; But in ancient times, The Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhioners have given or procured to the Parſon a Wood or other Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> to have and to hold to him and his Succeſſors in ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of all Tithes of Wood in the ſame Pariſh, and the Parſon is now ſeiſed of the ſame Wood, and that without queſtion is a good diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his Tithes; and that in ſuch caſe, if he ſueth for Tithes of Wood a Prohibition lieth: And therefore it hath been ſaid now of late. That ſuch opinions were new and without any antiquity, unto the great prejudice of the Church: I will cite you an ancient Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment many years paſt, <hi>Mich.</hi> 25 <hi>H.</hi> 3. <hi>Wilts.

               <p n="1">1. That ſatisfaction may be given in diſcharge of payment of Tithes; And if the Succeſſor of the Parſon enjoyeth the thing given in ſatisfaction of the Tithes, and ſueth for Tithes in kind, he ſhall have a Prohibition, becauſe that he chargeth his Lay Fee with Tithes, which is diſcharged of them. By which it appeareth that Tithes cannot be diſcharged, and altogether taken away and extinct: And herewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth the Regiſter which is the moſt ancient Book of the Law, <hi>fol.</hi> 38. <hi>Rex, &amp;c. tali Judici, &amp;c. ſaltem.

Et quia diſcuſſio hujuſmodi Donationis de laico feodo in regno noſtro in Curia noſtra, &amp; non alibi tractari &amp; fieri debet, vobis prohibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, Quod placitum aliquod laicum feodum in Regno noſtro non tene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atis in Curia Chriſtianitatis, nec quicquam in hac parte quod in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nervationem dicti ſcripti aut Donationis, &amp; conceſſionis praedict. quae in Curia noſtra &amp; non alibi tractari ſicut praedict. eſt cedere poterit attentetis, ſive attentim faciatis quoviſmodo;</hi> By which alſo it appeareth, That Tithes may be diſcharged, and that the matter of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge ought to be determined by the Common Law, and not in the Spirituall Court: And it is to be obſerved, That in the ſaid Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor in the Regiſter any averment is taken of the value of the thing given in ſatisfaction of the Tithes. Alſo by the Act of <hi>Circumſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cte agatis</hi> made, 13 <hi>E.</hi> 1. It is ſaid, <hi>S. Rector petat verſus parochianos oblationes, &amp; decimas debitas, ſeu conſuetas, &amp;c.</hi> which proves that there are Tithes due in kind. and other Tithes due by Cuſtome, as a <hi>Modus Decimandi, &amp;c.</hi> And yet it is reſolved in 19 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Juriſdiction</hi> 28. That the Ordinance of <hi>Circumſpecte agatis</hi> is not a Statute; and that the Prelates made the ſame, and yet then, the Prelates acknowledged,
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:98298:10"/> That there were Tithes due by Cuſtome, which is a <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> By which it appeareth alſo, That Tithes by Cuſtome may be altered into another thing: So where a man grants a parcel of his Mannor to a Parſon in Fee to be quit of Tithes and makes an Indenture, and the Parſon with the aſſent of the Ordinary (without the Patron) grants to him that he ſhall be quit of Tithes of his Mannor for that parcell of Land: Afterwards if he or his Aſſignee be ſued in the Spirituall Court for Tithes of his Mannor, he or his Aſſignee ſhall have a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition upon that Deed. And if that Deed was made before time of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, and he hath ſo continued to be quit of Tithes, he ſhall have a Prohibition upon that Deed, if he be ſued for the Tithes of that Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor or of any parcell of the ſame upon that matter ſhewed: See 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 41. <hi>g. vi.</hi> 3. <hi>E.</hi> 3. 17. 16 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>t. Annuity</hi> 24. 40 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 3. <hi>b.</hi> and <hi>F. N. B.</hi> 152. And therefore if the Lord of a Mannor hath alwaies holden his Mannor diſcharged of tithes, and the Parſon had before time of memory, or in ancient times divers Lands in the ſame Pariſh of the Gift of the Lord, of which the Parſon is ſeiſed at this day in Fee, in reſpect of which, the Parſon nor any of his Predeceſſors ever had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived any tithes of the ſaid Mannor: If the Parſon now ſueth for tithes of the Mannor, the Owner of the Mannor may ſhew that ſpeciall matter, and that the Parſon and his Succeſſors time out of mind have holden thoſe Lands, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> of the Gift of one who was Lord of the ſaid Mannor, in full ſatisfaction of the tithes of the ſaid Mannor; And the proof, that the Lord of the Mannor gave the Lands, that tithes ſhould never be paid, at this day is good evidence to prove the ſurmiſe of the Prohibition. And ſo of the like: and 19 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>t. Juriſdiction</hi> 28. it is adjudged, That Title of Preſcription, ſhall be determined in the Kings Court: And therefore a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> which accrueth by Cuſtome and Preſcription in the Kings Court. And it appeareth by the Statute of 6 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. That the Pope by his Bulls diſcharged di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers from payment of tithes, againſt which the Act of Parliament was made; and by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. That the Poſſeſſions of Religious perſons given to the King, were diſcharged of payment of tithes in certain Caſes: and by the Statute of 32 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, That all and ſingular perſons ſhall divide, ſet out, yeild, and pay all and ſingular tithes and Offerings aforeſaid, according to the lawfull cuſtomes and uſages of the Pariſhes and places where ſuch tithes or Duties ſhall come, or immediatly ariſe or be due: Provided alwaies, and be it enacted, That no perſon or perſons ſhall be ſued or otherwiſe compelled to pay any manner of tithes, for any Mannors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, which by the Laws or Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realm are diſcharged, or not chargable with the payment of any ſuch tithes: And the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. Enacts, That every of the Kings Subjects ſhall from henceforth juſtifie, and truly without fraud or guile, divide, ſet out, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> all manner of their prediall tithes in their proper kind as they will riſe and happen, in ſuch manner and form as hath been of right yeilded and paid, within forty years next before the making of this Act, or of Right or Cuſtome ought to be paid. So as it appeareth by this, that tithe is due of Right, and by Cuſtom: And alſo in the ſame Act there is a <hi>Proviſo</hi> in theſe words; Provided alwaies and be it enacted, That no perſon ſhall be ſued, or otherwiſe compelled to yeild, give, or pay any manner of tithes for any Mannors, Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments, which by the Laws and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes of this Realm, or by any Priviledge or Preſcription, are not
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:98298:11"/> chargable with the payment of any ſuch tithes, or that he diſcharged by any compoſition reall: ſo as it appeareth by that Act, that one may be diſcharged from the payment of tithes five manner of waies.</p>
               <p n="1">1. By the Law of the Realm, that is, the Common Law; As Tithes ſhall not be paid of Coals, Quarries, Brick, Tiles, <hi>&amp;c. F. N. B</hi> 53. and <hi>Regiſter</hi> 54 Nor of the after Paſture of a Meadow, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nor of Rakings, nor of Wood to make Pales, or Mounds, or Hedges, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. By the Statutes of the Realm: As by the Statute of 31 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. the Statute of 45 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. By Priviledge, as thoſe of S. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>England;</hi> The <hi>Ciſtertians, Temptors, &amp;c.</hi> as it appeareth by 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 277. <hi>Dyer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. By Preſcription, As by <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> or an annuall Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence in ſatisfaction of them, as appeareth before by the Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties aforeſaid.</p>
               <p n="5">5. By reall Compoſition, as appeareth by the ſaid Writ cited out of the Regiſter: And ſo you have one or two examples (for many others which may be added) of theſe five manners of diſcharges of Tithes. And by them all it appeareth, That a man may be diſcharged of the payment of Tithes, as before is ſaid: So as now it apparently ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> both Ancient and Modern, That a Lay-man ought preſcribe in <hi>modo Decimandi,</hi> but not in <hi>non Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mando:</hi> and that in effect agrees with the Opinion of <hi>Thomas Aqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas</hi> in his <hi>Secunda ſecundae, Quaeſt.</hi> 86. <hi>ar. ultimo.</hi> For there he ſaith, <hi>Quod in veteri lege praeceptum de ſolutione Decimarum, partim erat mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rali inditum ratione naturali quae dictat Quod iis Qui Divino Cultui miniſtrant ad ſalutem totius populi neceſſaria victui debent miniſtr. juxta illud,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Quis militat, &amp;c.</hi> Who goeth to War at his own char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, <hi>&amp;c. Partim autem erat judiciale ex Divina inſtitutione robur habens, (ſcil.) Quantum ad determinationem certae partis:</hi> And all that agrees with our Law; And he goeth further, <hi>In tempore vero Novae Legis e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam eſt determinatio partis ſolvendae authoritate Eccleſiae</hi> (That is by their Canons) <hi>Inſtituta ſecundum quandam humanitatem, ut ſcilicet non minus populus Novae Legis Miniſtros novi Teſtamenti exuberat, quam populus veteris Legis miniſtris veteris Teſtamenti exhibebat, praeſertim cum Miniſtri Novae Legis ſunt Majores Dignitate, ut probat Apoſtolus</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3. <hi>Sic ergo patet Quod ad ſolutionem Decimarum tenentur homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes partim quidem ex jure naturali, quantum ad hoc quod aliqua portio data eſt miniſtris Eccleſiae, partim vero ex inſtitutione Eccleſiae quantum ad determinationem Decimae Partis.</hi> See <hi>Doctor and Student Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 55. <hi>fol.</hi> 164. That the tenth part is not due by the Law of God, nor by the Law of Nature, which he calleth the Law of Reaſon: And he ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth <hi>John Gerſon</hi> who was a Doctor of Divinity, in a Treatiſe which he calleth <hi>Regulae morales (ſcil.) Solutio Decimaram ſacerdotibus eſt de jure Divino, quatenus inde ſuſtententur, ſed quo ad tam hanc vel illam aſſignare aut in alios redditus Commutare poſitivi juris eſt.</hi> And after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, <hi>Non vocatur Portio Curatis debita propterea Decimae, eo quod eſt Decima pars, imo eſt interdum viceſima,</hi> aut <hi>triceſima.</hi> And he hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, That a Portion is due by the Law of Nature, which is the Law of God, but it appertaineth to the Law of Man to aſſign, <hi>Hanc vel illam portionem,</hi> as neceſſity requireth for their Suſtenance. And further he ſaith, That Tithes may be exchanged into Lands, Annuity, or Rent, which ſhall be ſufficient for the Miniſter, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there he ſaith, That in <hi>Italy,</hi> and in other the Eaſt Countries, they pay no Tithes, but a certain Portion according to the Cuſtome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And all this is true, if
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:98298:11"/> not, that Tithes be diſcharged or changed by one of the ſaid five waies: And foraſmuch as it appeareth by themſelves, that the part or value was part of the Iudiciall Law, certainly the ſame doth not bind any Chriſtian Common-wealth, but that the ſame may be altered by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of time, place, or other conſideration, as it appeareth in all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments inflicted by the Iudiciall Law, they do not bind none, for Felony is now puniſhed by death, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which was not ſo by the Iudiciall Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo foraſmuch as now it is confeſſed, that the tenth part is now due, <hi>Ex inſtitutione Eccleſiae,</hi> that is to ſay, By their Canons, and it appeareth by the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 19. That all Canons, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made againſt the Prerogative of the King in his Laws, Statutes, or Cuſtomes of the Realm are void; and that was but a Declaratory Law; For no Statute or Cuſtome of the Realm can be taken away or abrogated by any Canon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> made out or within the Realm, but only by Act of Parliament: and that well appeareth by 10 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 17. <hi>c.</hi> 18. That there is a Canon or Conſtitution, That no Prieſt ought to be impleaded at the Common Law. And there <hi>Brian</hi> ſaith, That a grave Doctor of the Law once ſaid unto him, That Prieſts and Clarks might be ſued at the Common Law well enough; For he ſaid, that <hi>Rex eſt perſona mixta,</hi> and is <hi>Perſona unita cum Sacerdotibus Statutis Eccleſiae.</hi> In which caſe the King might maintain his Iuriſdiction by preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; By which it appeareth that preſcription doth prevail againſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe Canons or Conſtitutions and is not taken away by them, which proves that the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was but a Declaration of the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Law before: And there is an expreſſe Prohibition in <hi>Numb.</hi> 18. <hi>Nihil aliud poſſedebunt, Decimarum oblatione contenti quas in uſus eo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ram &amp; neceſſaria ſeparavi:</hi> Which was not part of the Morall Law, or Law of Nature, but part of the Iudiciall: And therefore men of the holy Church at this day do poſſeſſe Houſes, Lands, and Tenements, and not Tithes only. The ſecond point which agrees with the Law at this day, which was adjudged in the ſaid Record of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 3. is, That the limits and bounds of Towns and Pariſhes ſhall be tried by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, and not in the Spirituall Court: and in this the Law hath great reaſon, for thereupon depends the Title of Inheritance of the Lay Fee, whereof the Tithes were demanded for Fines, and Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries are the common aſſurances of Lay Inheritances: and if the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Court ſhould try the bounds of Towns, if they determine that my Land lyeth in another Town then is contained in my Fine, Reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very, or other aſſurance, I ſhall be in danger to loſe my Inheritance, and therewith agreeth 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 29. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 5. 10. 32 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>t. Conſultation,</hi> 3 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 12 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 20. 50 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 20. &amp; many other Preſidents untill this day. And note, there is a Rule in Law, that when the Right of tithes ſhall be tried in the Spiritual Court, &amp; the Spirit. Court hath juriſdiction therof that our Courts ſhall be ouſted of the Iuriſdiction, 35 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 47. 38 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 21. 2 <hi>E</hi> 4. 15. 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 23. 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 36. 14 <hi>H</hi> 7. 17. 13 <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>Juriſd.</hi> 19. but that is when debate is between Parſon and Vicar, or when all is in one Pariſh, but when they are in ſeverall Pariſhes, then this Court ſhall not be ouſted of the Iuriſdiction. See 12 <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>to Juriſdiction</hi> 17. 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>ibid.</hi> 19. 7 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 34. 14 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 17. 38 <hi>E</hi> 3. 56. 42 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 12.

And ſo <hi>fol.</hi> 227, 228. amongſt the Canons or Conſtitutions of <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face, An. Dom.</hi> 1277. And the cauſes wherefore the Iudges of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law would not permit the Eccleſiaſticall Iudges to try <hi>Modum Decimandi,</hi> being pleaded in their Court is, becauſe that if the Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence

               <p n="1">1. That the ſaid Fine with proclamations ſhould bar the Wife of her Dower, and the Attainder of her Husband ſhould not help her; for as long as the Attainder doth remain in force, the ſame was a bar alſo of her Dower, ſo as there was a double bar to the Wife, <hi>viz.</hi> the Fine levyed with proclamations, and the five years paſt after the death of her Husband, and the Attainder of her Husband of his Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.

               <p>It was ſecondly objected, That the Wife could not have a Petition, becauſe there was not any Office by which her title of Dower was found, <hi>ſcil.</hi> her marriage, the ſeiſin of her Husband, and death: for it was ſaid, that although ſhe was marryed, yet if her Husband was not ſeiſed after the age that ſhe is Dowable, ſhe ſhall not have Dower: as if a man ſeiſed of Land in Fee, taketh to Wife a woman of eight years, and afterwards before her age of nine years, the Husband ali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eneth the Lands in Fee, and afterwards the woman attaineth to the age of nine years, and the Husband dyeth; it was ſaid, that the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſhall not be endowed.

               </p>
               <p>As to the firſt Objection, it was reſolved, That the Wife ſhould be endowed, and that the Fine with proclamations was not a bar unto her, and yet it was reſolved that the Act of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>cap.</hi> 24. ſhall bar a woman of her Dower by a Fine levyed by her Husband with procla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations, if the woman doth not bring her Writ of Dower within five years after the death of her Husband, as it was adjudged <hi>Hill.</hi> 4 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Rot.</hi> 344. in the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and 5 <hi>Eliz.

But if any ſtranger hath done a Treſpaſſe upon the Land in the mean time, he who recovereth after the Reverſall ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſſe againſt the Treſpaſſors, and if the Defendant pleadeth that there is no ſuch Record, the Plaintiff ſhall ſhew the ſpeciall matter, and ſhall maintain his Action, ſo as unto the Treſpaſſors who are wrong Doers, the Law ſhall not make any conſtruction by way of <hi>relation ab initio</hi> to excuſe them, for then the Law by a fiction and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction ſhould do wrong to him who recovereth by the firſt Iudgment: And for the better apprehending of the Law on this point, it is to know, That when any man recovers any poſſeſſion or ſeiſin of Land, in any Action by erroneous Iudgment, and afterwards the Iudgment is reverſed as is ſaid before, and upon that the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error ſhall have a Writ of Reſtitution, and that Writ recites the firſt recovery, and the reverſall of it in the Writ of Error, is, that the Plaintiff in the Writ of Error ſhall be reſtored to his poſſeſſion and ſeiſin, <hi>Una cum exitibus</hi> thereof from the time of the Iudgment, <hi>&amp;c.

<pb n="22" facs="tcp:98298:14"/> command the Sheriff to enquire of the Iſſues and Profits generally, between the Reverſal and the Iudgment, with all which he who reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers ſhall be charged: and as the Law chargeth him with all the mean profits, ſo the Law gives to him remedy notwithſtanding the Reverſal againſt all Treſpaſſors in the <hi>interim,</hi> for otherwiſe the Law ſhould make a conſtruction by relation to diſcharge them who are wrong doers, and to charge him who recovers with the whole, who peradven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath good right, and who entereth by the Iudgment of the Law, which peradventure is reverſed for want of form, or negligence or ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of a Clark. And therefore as to that purpoſe the Iudgment ſhall not be reverſed <hi>ab initio</hi> by a Fiction of Law, but as the truth was, the ſame ſtands in force until it was reverſed: and therefore the Plaintiff in the <hi>Writ of Error</hi> after the Reverſal ſhall have any Action of Treſpaſs for a Treſpaſs mean, becauſe he ſhall recover all the mean profits againſt him who recovered, nor he recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth after ſhall be barred of his Action of Treſpaſs for a Treſpaſs mean, by reaſon that his recovery is reverſed, becauſe he ſhall anſwer for all the mean profits to the Plaintiff in the <hi>Writ of Error:</hi> and therewith agreeth <hi>Brian</hi> Chief Iuſtice, 4 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 12. <hi>a.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Note Reader, If you would underſtand the true ſence and Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Law, it is needful for you to know the true Entries of Iudgments, and the Entries of all proceedings in Law, and the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner and the matter of Writs of Execution of ſuch Iudgments. See <hi>Butler</hi> and <hi>Bakers</hi> Caſe, in the third part of my <hi>Reports,</hi> good matter concerning Relations. So as it was reſolved in the Caſe at Bar, Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that to ſome intent the Reverſal hath relation, yet to bar the Wife of her Dower by Fiction of Law, by the Fine with proclamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and five years paſt after the death of her Husband, when in truth ſhe had not cauſe of Action, nor any right or title ſo long as the Attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſtood in force, ſhould be to do wrong by a Fiction of Law, and to bar the Wife, who was a meer ſtranger, and who had not any means, to have any Relief until the Attainder was reverſed.</p>
               <p>And as unto the other point or Objection, that the Demandant on the Petition ought to have an Office found for her, it was reſolved, that it needed not in this caſe, becauſe that the title of Dower ſtood with the <hi>Queens</hi> title, and affirmed it, otherwiſe if the title of the Demandant in the Petition had diſaffirmed the <hi>Queens</hi> title: alſo in this Caſe, the <hi>Queen</hi> was not entituled by any Office that the Wife ſhould be driven to traverſe it, &amp;c. for then ſhe ought to have had an Office to finde her title: But in Caſe of Dower, although that Office had been found for the <hi>Queen</hi> which doth not diſaffirm the title of Dower, in ſuch caſe the Wife ſhall have her Petition without Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, becauſe that Dower is favored in Law, ſhe claiming but onely for term of life, and affirming the title of the <hi>Queen.</hi> See the <hi>Sadlers</hi> Caſe in the fourth part of my <hi>Reports.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the caſe which was put on the other ſide was utterly denyed by the Court, for it was reſolved, That if a man ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, taketh a Wife of eight years of age, and alieneth his Lands, and afterwards the Wife attaineth to the age of nine years, and afterwards the Husband dyeth, that the Wife ſhall be endowed: For although at the time of the alienation the Wife was not dowable, yet for as much as the marriage, and ſeiſin in Fee, was before the alienation, and the title of Dower is not conſummate until the death of her Husband, ſo as now there was marriage, ſeiſin of Fee, age of nine years during
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:98298:14"/> the Coverture, and the death of the Husband, for that cauſe ſhe ſhall be endowed: For it is not requiſite that the marriage, ſeiſin and age concur together all at one time, but it is ſufficient if they happen du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Coverture: So if a man ſeiſed of Lands in Fee take a Wife, and afterwards ſhe elopes from her Husband, now ſhe is barrable of her Dower, if during the Elopement the Husband alieneth, and after the Wife is reconciled, the Wife ſhall be endowed: So if a man hath iſſue by his Wife, and the iſſue dyeth, and afterwards Land deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Wife, or the Wife purchaſeth Lands in Fee, and dyeth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any other iſſue, the Husband (for the iſſue which he had before the Diſcent or purchaſe) ſhall be Tenant by the curteſie, for it is ſufficient if he have iſſue, and that the Wife be ſeiſed during the Coverture, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that it be at ſeveral times. But if a man taketh an Alien to Wife, and afterwards he alieneth his Lands, and afterwards ſhe is made a Denizen, ſhe ſhall not be endowed, for ſhe was abſolutely diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled by the Law, and by her birth not capable of Dower, but her ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and ability began onely by her Denization, but in the other caſe there was not any incapacity or diſability in the perſon, but onely a temporary Bar, until ſuch age or reconcilement, which being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the temporary Bar ceaſeth: As if a man ſeiſed of Lands in Fee, taketh a Wife, and afterwards the Wife is attainted of Felony, and afterwards the Husband alieneth, and afterwards the Wife is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and afterwards the Husband dyeth, the Wife ſhall be endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for by her birth ſhe was not uncapable, but was lawfully by her marriage and ſeiſin in Fee entituled to have Dower; and therefore when the impediment is removed, ſhe ſhall be endowed.</p>

<pb n="25" facs="tcp:98298:15"/> in length ten Inches, <hi>non attingebat,</hi> to the ſumme of twelve ſhillings four pence, according to the form of the Statute aforeſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The Defendant pleaded <hi>Nihil debet,</hi> And at the <hi>Niſi prius,</hi> the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of two Witneſſes was, That the Plaintiff cauſed the ſaid Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament which was in Paper, to be ingroſſed in Parchment; And the Plaintiff offered both to the ſaid <hi>Rowſe,</hi> the Officiall, to be proved, and he anſwered, That he would prove it, if his Fees ſhall be paid to him, And the Plaintiff asked him what were his Fees, and he wrote them in a paper, which amounted to fourteen ſhillings ten pence for the Probat, inſinuation, Regiſtring, and ſealing: And thereupon the Plaintiff layed upon the Table twenty ſhillings, and deſired him to take as much as was due to him, and all that was in the houſe of the Officiall; But he would receive nothing there, but appointed the Plaintiff to come in Court, where he would receive his Fees, and accordingly the Plaintiff came to him in Court, and prayed to have the ſaid Will proved; And the Defendant required the ſaid <hi>Nicke</hi> his Miniſter, to take of him for the probation, inſinuation, regiſtring, and ſealing, fourteen ſhillings ten pence, and thereupon he put the Seale of his Office to the ſaid Parchment ingroſſed, which the Plaintiff brought with him, and which he delivered to the Defendant. And it was objected. That this Caſe was out of the ſaid Statute, for thereby as to this purpoſe, it is provided, <hi>viz.</hi> And where the Goods of the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtator, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> amount above the value of forty pounds, That then the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, nor Ordinary by him or themſelves, nor any of his or their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſters, Scribes, Prayſers, Summoners, Apparators, or any other their Miniſters, for the probation, inſinuation, and approbation of any Teſtament or Teſtaments, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for the regiſtring, ſealing, writing, prayſing, making of Inventories, making Acquittances, Fines, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing concerning the ſame Probate of Teſtaments, ſhall take or cauſe to be taken of any perſon or perſons, but only four ſhillings, and not above, whereof to the Biſhop, ordinary, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> for him and his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters two ſhillings ſix pence, and not above, and two ſhillings ſix pence to the Scribe for Regiſtring of the ſame, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And it was objected by the Councell of the Defendant, that the Defendant did not take the fourteen ſhillings ten pence for the probation, inſinuation, regiſtring, or ſealing of the Teſtament, for no Probat was written upon the Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament it ſelf, nor any Seale put to it, but the Teſtament was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in Parchment, and the Probat and Seale put to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript ingroſſed, and not to the Teſtament it ſelf, and ſo out of the Statute; and the Statute extends only, when the Probat and Seale is put to the Teſtament it ſelf, and for the ingroſſing of it after the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, no certain Fee is provided by the Statute; But for the Regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring of it after it is proved, there is an expreſſe Fee in the Statute: But I conceived that the ſaid taking of the fourteen ſhillings ten pence in the Caſe at Bar, was directly againſt the Statute. For the Act is in the Negative, and if the Executor requireth the Teſtament to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſed in Parchment, he ought to agree with him who he requireth to do it, as he may: But the Ordinary, Officiall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ought not to exact any Fee for the ſame of the party as a thing due to him, for divers Cauſes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe the words of the Act are expreſſed, for the Probation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and for the regiſtring, ſealing, writing, prayſing, making of Invento<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, Fines, giving of Acquittances, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which word <hi>(writing)</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends expreſly to this Caſe.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="26" facs="tcp:98298:16"/> 2. The words are, Or any thing concerning the ſame Probate, and when the Seal and Probate is put to the Tranſcript, the ſame without queſtion concerns the Probate, for the Probat is not put to any wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting but only to that, therefore the ſame concerns the Probate.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Such a Conſtruction ſhould make the Act idle and vain, for if the Ordinary, Officiall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> might take as much as he pleaſeth for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groſſing done by his Miniſters as a Fee due to him, all the purview of the Statute which is penned ſo preciſely concerning perſons, <hi>ſcil.</hi> Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, Ordinaries, and all perſons who have power to prove Wills and Teſtaments, Regiſters, Scribes, Summoners, Apparations, or any other the Miniſters, as for the thing it ſelf, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the probation, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, approbation, regiſtring, ſealing, writing, prayſing, making of Inventories, Fines, giving of Acquittances, or any other thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the ſame, ſhould be all in vain, by that evaſion of Tranſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing of it, as well againſt the expreſſe Letter of the Act as the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and moving of it: Alſo the Statute ſaith five ſhillings, and not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, ſo as the manner of preciſe penning of it excludes all nice evaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: And the Act ought to be expounded to ſuppreſſe Extortion, which is a great affliction, and impoveriſhing of the poor Subjects.</p>
               <p n="4">4. As this Caſe is, he annexeth the Probate and Seale to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript ingroſſed, which the Plaintiff brought with him and offered to the Defendant; ſo as the Caſe at Bar was without queſtion, And ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Ordinary, Officiall, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> cannot exact or take any Fee for any thing which concerns the Probate of a Will or Teſtament, but that which the Statute limits: And afterwards the Iury found for the Plaintiff; and of ſuch opinion was <hi>Walmeſley, Warberton, Daniel,</hi> and <hi>Foſter</hi> Iuſtices, the next Term in all things, But upon exception in Arreſt of Iudgment for not purſuing of the Act, in the Informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Iudgment is not yet given, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

That none might levy ſuch Ayd, to make his ſon a Knight, until his ſon be of the age of fifteen years; nor to marry his daughter, until ſhe be of the age of ſeven years. And <hi>Fleta,</hi> who wrote after the ſaid Act, calls them <hi>rationabilia auxilia ad filium militem faciendum, vel ad filiam primo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genitam maritandum:</hi> And by the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 1. where it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, That no Taxes ſhall be taken but by common conſent of the Realm, there is an exception of the ancient Ayds, &amp;c. which is to be intended of theſe Ayds due unto the King by the ancient Common Law: But notwithſtanding the ſaid Act of <hi>VVeſtm.</hi> 1. it was doubted, whether the King, becauſe he is not expreſly named, were bound by it; and therefore in the twentieth year of <hi>E.</hi> 3. the King took an Ayd of 40 <hi>s.</hi> of every Knights Fee for to make the Black Prince Knight, and nothing then of Lands holden in Socage; and to take away all que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion concerning the ſame, the ſame was confirmed to him in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and afterwards, <hi>anno</hi> 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. it is enacted, That rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable Ayd to make the Kings eldeſt Son Knight, and to marry his eldeſt Daughter, ſhall be demanded and levyed after the form of the Statute made thereof, and not in other manner, that is to ſay, Of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Fee holden of the King without Mean 20 <hi>s.</hi> and no more, and of every 20 <hi>l.</hi> Land holden of the King without Mean in Socage 20 <hi>s.</hi> and no more.

               <p>And it is to be obſerved, and ſo it appeareth in the Regiſter, <hi>fo.</hi> 1, <hi>&amp;</hi> 2. That in a <hi>Writ of Right,</hi> if the Lands or Tenements are holden by Knights ſervice, it is ſaid, <hi>Quas clamat tenere de te per ſervitium unius feodi Militis:</hi> and if the Lands be holden in Socage, the Writ is, <hi>Quis clamat tenere de te per liberum ſervitium unius libri cumini, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as Socage Tenure in all Writs is called <hi>Liberum ſervitium.</hi> And by the Writ of Ayd, <hi>Fitz.

                  <pb n="28" facs="tcp:98298:17"/> and by the ſaid Books it appeareth, that Tenure by Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>almoign, and Tenure by Divine Service, ſhall not pay, for they are none of them: but Tenure in Burgage is a Tenure in Socage; and therefore the ſaid Books prove, that ſuch a Tenure ſhall pay Ayd. And I conceive, that Tenure by <hi>Petit-Serjanty</hi> ſhall pay alſo Ayd: for <hi>Litt. lib.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 8. <hi>fo.</hi> 36. ſays, That ſuch a Tenure is but Socage in effect: but <hi>Fitz.

That Tenant by <hi>Petit-Serjanty</hi> ſhall not pay Ayd; but the Book onely extends to <hi>Grand-Serjanty:</hi> If the Houſes in a City or Borough are holden of the King in Burgage, and the King grant the Seignories to one, and the City or Borough to another to hold of him, then thoſe Houſes ſhall not be contributary to Ayd, for they are not immediately holden of the King, as is required by the Law.</p>
               <p>And I conceive that he who holdeth a Rent of the King by Knights ſervice, or in Socage, ſhall pay Ayd; for the words of the Act of <hi>VVeſtm.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 35. are, From henceforth of a whole Knights Fee onely be taken 20 <hi>s.</hi> of 20 <hi>l.</hi> Land holden in Socage 20 <hi>s.</hi> and the Mean is ſaid in ſuppoſition of Law to hold the Land: and it is not rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that the Tenant by his Feoffment before the Statute ſhould preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice the Lord of his benefit. And although it was ſaid, that a Tenure in Socage, <hi>in ſervitium Socae,</hi> as <hi>Littleton</hi> ſaith, and the ſame cannot be applyed to Houſes: to that it was anſwered, That the Land upon which the Houſe is built, or if the Houſe falleth down, may be made arable, and be ploughed. And a Rent may be holden in Socage, and yet it is not ſubject to be plowed, but by a poſſibility after words eſcheat to the Lord of the Land.

                  </gap> day of <hi>February,</hi> 1606. A great Complaint was made by the Preſident of <hi>York</hi> unto the King, That the Iudges of the Common Law had, in contempt of the Command of the King the laſt Term, granted ſixty or fifty Prohibitions at the leaſt out of the Common-Pleas to the Preſident and Councel of <hi>York</hi> after the ſixth day of <hi>February,</hi> and named three in particular, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> between <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Thawptes,</hi> another between <hi>Snell</hi> and <hi>Huet,</hi> and another in an Information of a Riotous Reſcue preferred by Engliſh Bill by the Attorny General againſt <hi>Chriſtopher Dickenſon,</hi> one of the Sheriffs of <hi>York,</hi> and divers others, in reſcuing of one <hi>William Watſon</hi> out of the Cuſtody of the Deputy of one of the Purſuivants of the ſame Councel who had arreſted the ſaid <hi>Watſon</hi> by force of a Commiſſion of Rebellion awarded by the Preſident and Councel, which Prohibition in the ſaid Information was (as was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed) denyed upon a motion made in the <hi>Kings Bench</hi> the laſt Term, and yet granted by us. And the King ſent for me to anſwer to that Complaint: and I onely, all the reſt of the Iuſtices being abſent, waited upon the King in the Chamber neer the Gallery; Who, in the preſence of <hi>Egerton</hi> Lord Chancellor, the Earl of <hi>Salisbury</hi> Lord Treaſurer, the Lord of <hi>Northampton</hi> Lord Privy Seal, the Earl of <hi>Suffolk</hi> Lord Chamberlain, the Earl of <hi>Worceſter,</hi> the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Lord <hi>Wotton,</hi> and others of his Councel, rehearſed to me the Complaint aforeſaid: and I perceived well, that upon the
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:98298:18"/> ſaid Information he had conceived great diſpleaſure againſt the Iudges of the <hi>Common Pleas,</hi> and chiefly againſt me; To which I (having the Copy of the Complaint ſent to me by the Lord Treaſurer the Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath day before) anſwered in this manner, That I had, with as much brevity as the time would permit, made ſearch in the Offices of the <hi>Preignothories</hi> of the <hi>Common Pleas:</hi> and as to the ſaid Caſes between <hi>Bell</hi> and <hi>Thawptes,</hi> and <hi>Snell</hi> and <hi>Huet,</hi> no ſuch could be found: but my intent was not to take advantage of a Miſpriſal: and the truth was, that the ſixth day of <hi>February</hi> the Court of <hi>Common Pleas</hi> had granted a Prohibition to the Preſident and Councel of <hi>York,</hi> between <hi>Lock</hi> Plaintiff, and <hi>Bell</hi> and others Defendants: and that was, a <hi>Replevyn</hi> in Engliſh was granted by the ſaid Preſident and Councel, which I affirmed was utterly againſt Law: For at the Common Law no <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plevyn</hi> ought to be made, but by Original Writ directed to the Sheriff. And the Statute of <hi>Marlbridg cap.</hi> 21. and <hi>Weſt.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 17. hath authorized the Sheriff upon Plaint made to him, to make a <hi>Replevyn;</hi> and all that appeareth by the ſaid Statutes, and by the Books of 29 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 21. 8 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 245. And the King neither by his Inſtructions had made the Preſident and Councel Sheriffs, nor could grant to them power to make a <hi>Replevyn</hi> againſt the Law, nor againſt the ſaid Acts of Parliament; but the ſame ought to be made by the Sheriff. And all that was affirmed by the Lord Chancellor for very good Law: And I ſay, that it might well be that we have granted other Prohibitions in other Caſes of <hi>Engliſh Replevyns.</hi> Another Prohibition I confeſs we have granted between Sir <hi>Bethel Knight,</hi> now Sheriff of the County of <hi>York,</hi> as Executor to one <hi>Stephenſon,</hi> who had made him and another his Executors, and preferred an Engliſh Bill againſt <hi>Chambers,</hi> and divers others in the nature of an Action upon the Caſe, upon a Trover and Converſion in the life of the Teſtator of goods and Chattels, to the value of 1000 <hi>l.</hi> and becauſe the other Executor would not joyn with him, although he was named in the Bill, he had not any remedy at the Common Law, he prayed remedy there in Equity: and I ſay, that the Preſident and Councel have not any authority to proceed in that Caſe, for divers cauſes.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is an expreſs limitation in their Commiſſion, that they ſhall not hold plea between party and party &amp;c. unleſs both parties, or one of them, <hi>tanta paupertate ſunt gravati,</hi> that they cannot ſue at the Common Law: and in that caſe the Plaintiff was a Knight, and Sheriff, and a man of great ability.</p>
               <p n="2">2. By that Suit the King was deceived of his Fine, for he ought to have had 200 <hi>l.</hi> Fine, becauſe that the damages amounted to 4000 <hi>l.</hi> and that was one of the cauſes that the Sheriff began his Suit there, and not at the Common Law: another cauſe was, that their Decrees which they take upon them are final and uncontroulable, either by Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror, or any other remedy. And yet the Preſident is a Noble-man, but not learned in the Law; and thoſe which are of the Councel there, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though that they have the countenance of Law, yet they are not learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Law; and nevertheleſs they take upon them final and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable Decrees in matters of great importance: For if they may deny Relief to any at their pleaſure without controulment, ſo they may do it by their final Decrees without Error, Appeal, or other remedy: which is not ſo in the Kings Courts where there are five Iudges; for they can deny Iuſtice to none who hath Right, nor give any Iudgment, but the ſame is controulable by a <hi>Writ of Error, &amp;c.</hi>
                  <pb n="32" facs="tcp:98298:19"/> And if we ſhall not grant Prohibitions in Caſes where they hold Plea without authority, then the ſubjects ſhall be wrongfully oppreſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Law, and we denyed to do them Iuſtice: And their ignorance in the Law appeared by their allowance of that Suit, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That the one Executor had no remedy by the Common Law, becauſe the other would not joyn in ſuit with him at the Common Law: whereas every one learned in the Law knoweth, that ſummons and ſeverance lieth in any Suit brought as Executors: and this alſo in that particular Caſe was affirmed by the Lord Chancellor; and he much inveighed againſt Actions brought there upon Trover and Converſion, and ſaid, that they could not be found in our ancient Books.</p>
               <p>Another Prohibition I confeſs we have granted, between the L. <hi>Whar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> who by Engliſh Bill ſued before the Counsel, <hi>Banks, Buttermere,</hi> and others, for fiſhing in his ſeveral Fiſhings in <hi>Darwent</hi> in the County of <hi>C.</hi> in the nature of an Action of Treſpaſs at the Common Law, to his damages of 200 <hi>l.</hi> and for the cauſes next before recited, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the ſame was meerly determinable at the Common Law, we granted a Prohibition, and that alſo was allowed by the Lord Chancel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor. And as to the caſe of Information upon the Riotous Reſcous, I having forgotten to ſpeak to that, the King himſelf asked what the Caſe was? to whom I anſwered, that the caſe was, That one exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited a Bill there in the nature of an Action of Debt, upon a <hi>Mutuatus</hi> againſt <hi>Watſon,</hi> who upon his Oath affirmed, that he had ſatisfied the Plaintiff, and that he owed him nothing, and yet becauſe the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did not deny the Debt, the Councel decreed the ſame againſt him, and upon that Decree the Purſuivant was ſent to arreſt the ſaid <hi>Wat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> who arreſted him upon which the Reſcous was made: and becauſe that the Suit was in the nature of an Action of Debt upon a <hi>Mutuatus</hi> at the Common Law, and the Defendant at the Common Law might have waged his Law, of which the Defendant ought not to be barred by that Engliſh Bill, <hi>quia beneficium juris nemini eſt auferendum:</hi> the Prohibition was granted; and that was affirmed alſo by the Lord Chancellor: whereupon I concluded, that if the principal cauſe doth not belong unto them, all their proceedings was <hi>coram non Judice,</hi> and then no Reſcous could be done: but the Lord Chancellor ſaid, that though the ſame cannot be a Reſcous, yet it was a Riot, which might be puniſhed there: which I denyed, unleſs it were by courſe of Law by force of a Commiſſion of <hi>Oyer</hi> and <hi>Terminer,</hi> and not by an Engliſh Bill: but to give the King full ſatisfaction in that point, the truth is, the ſaid Caſe was debated in Court, and the Court inclined to grant a Prohibition in the ſaid caſe; but the ſame was ſtayed to be better ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed upon, ſo as no Prohibition was ever under Seal in the ſaid Caſe.</p>
               <p>Alſo I confeſs, that we have granted divers Prohibitions to ſtay Suits there by Engliſh <hi>Bill</hi> upon penal Statutes: for the manner of proſecution, as well for the Action, Proces, &amp;c. as for the count, is to be purſued, and cannot be altered; and therefore without queſtion the Councel in ſuch caſes cannot hold Plea, which was alſo affirmed by the Lord Chancellor. And I ſaid, that it was reſolved in the Reign of Queen <hi>Eliz.</hi> in <hi>Parots</hi> Caſe, and now lately in the Caſe of the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Councel of <hi>Wales,</hi> That no Court of Equity can be erected at this day without Act of Parliament, for the reaſons and cauſes in the Report of the ſaid Caſe of <hi>Parrot.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the King was well ſatisfied with theſe reaſons and cauſes of
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:98298:19"/> our proceedings, who of his Grace gave me his Royall hand, and I departed from thence in his favour. And the ſurmiſe of the Number, and that the Prohibition in the ſaid Caſe in the Information was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the <hi>Kings Bench,</hi> was utterly denied: for the ſame was moved when two Iudges were in Court, who gave not any opinion therein, but required Serjeant <hi>Hutton</hi> who moved it, to move the ſame again when the Court was full, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

Alſo a man may be bounden to repaire a Bridge, <hi>ratione Tenurae</hi> of certain Land, But a particular perſon can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be bound by preſcription, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That he and all his Anceſtors have repaired the Bridge, if it be not in reſpect of the Tenure of his Land, taking of Toll, or other profit; for the Act of the Anceſtor, cannot charge the Heir without profit. But an Abbot or other Corporation who hath a lawfull being may be charged, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That he and his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors time out of mind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> have repaired the Bridge; For the Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bot and Covent may bind their Succeſſors, <hi>vide</hi> 21 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 28. 27 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 8. 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 8. 5 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 3.

So it is of a High-way of common Right, all the Country ought for to repaire it, becauſe that the Country have their eaſe and paſſage by it, which ſtands with the reaſon of the Caſe of the Bridge, but yet ſome may be particularly boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to repaire it as is aforeſaid. He who hath the Land adjoyning, ought of common Right without preſcription to ſcoure and cleanſe the Ditches, next to the way to his Land: and therewith agreeth the Book of 8 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 5. But he who hath Land adjoyning without preſcription, is not bound to repair the way. So of a common River, of common Right all who have eaſe and paſſage by it, ought to cleanſe and ſcoure it; For a common River is as a common Street, as it is ſaid in 22 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> and 37 <hi>Aſſ.</hi> 10. But he who hath Land adjoyning to the River is not bounden to cleanſe the River, unleſſe he hath the benefit of it, <hi>ſcil.</hi> a Toll, or a Fiſhing, or other profit.

               <head>Sir William Reades and Boothes Caſe.</head>
               <p>IN the great Caſe in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> of a Forgery, Between Sir <hi>William Read</hi> Plaintiff, and <hi>Roger Booth,</hi> and <hi>Cutbert Booth,</hi> and others Defendants: the Caſe was this;</p>
               <p>The ſaid <hi>Roger Booth</hi> 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> was convicted in that Court of the publication of a Writing under Seal, forged in the name of Sir <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Greſham,</hi> of a Rent-charge of a hundred pounds, cut of all his Lands and Tenements, to one <hi>Markham</hi> for ninety nine years, bearing date the one and twentieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth;</hi> the ſaid <hi>Roger</hi> know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to be forged, And afterwards the ſaid Sir <hi>William Read</hi> exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the ſaid Bill againſt the ſaid <hi>Boothes,</hi> and others, for forging of another writing under Seal bearing date the twentieth of <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the name of the ſaid Sir <hi>Thomas Greſham,</hi> purporting a Deed of Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all his Lands (except certain) to Sir <hi>Rowland Heyward</hi> and <hi>Edward Hoogon</hi> and their Heirs, to certain uſes, which was in effect to the uſe of <hi>Markham</hi> the younger and his Heirs: And for the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſaid Writing, knowing the ſame to be forged, was the Bill exhibited. And now upon the hearing of the Cauſe in the <hi>Star-Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber</hi> this Term: Theſe doubts were moved upon the Statute of 5 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi> 1. If one who is convicted of publication of a Deed of Feoffment of Rent-charge, knowing the ſame to be forged: Again at another day forge another Deed of Feoffment, or Rent-charge, if he be within the caſe of Felony within the ſaid Act, which doubt ariſeth upon theſe words <hi>(eftſoons)</hi> committed again any of the ſaid Offences) And therefore it was objected, that he ought to commit again the ſame na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of Offence, <hi>ſcil.</hi> If he were convicted of Forgery he ought to forge again, and not only publiſh, knowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if firſt he were convi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted of publiſhing, knowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> he ought to offend again in publication, knowing, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and not in Forgery, for <hi>(eftſoons)</hi> which is <hi>(iterum)</hi> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plyeth that it ought to be of the ſame nature of Offence. The ſecond doubt was, If a man committeth two Forgeries, the one in 37 of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and the other in 38. and he is firſt convicted of the laſt, if he may be now impeached for the firſt. The third doubt was, when <hi>Roger Booth</hi> was convicted in 38 <hi>Eliz.</hi> and afterwards is charged with a new Forgery in 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> If the Witneſſes proving in truth that it was forged after the firſt conviction, if the <hi>Star Chamber</hi> hath Iuriſdiction of it. The laſt doubt was, when <hi>Cutbert Booth</hi> who never was convicted of For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery before, if in truth the Forgery was done, and ſo proved in 38 <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liz.</hi> If he might be convicted upon this Bill, becauſe that the Forgery is alledged before that it was done. As to the firſt and ſecond doubts, it was reſolved by the two chief Iuſtices and the chief Baron, that if any one be convicted of Forgery or publication of any Writing concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Freehold, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within the firſt Branch; or concerning Intereſt or Term for years, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> within the ſecond Branch, and be convicted, if af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards he offend either againſt the firſt Branch or ſecond, that the ſame is Felony: As if he forgeth a Writing concerning intereſt for years within the ſecond branch, and be convicted, and afterwards he forgeth a Charter of Feoffment within the firſt branch, or <hi>è converſo,</hi>
                  <pb n="35" facs="tcp:98298:20"/> that that is Felony, and that by expreſſe words of the Act: That if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſon or perſons being hereafter convicted or condemned of any of the ſaid Offences, which words (any of the ſaid Offences, extend to all the Offences mentioned before, either in the firſt branch, or in the ſecond branch) by any the waies or means above limited, ſhall after a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſuch conviction or condemnation, eftſoons commit or perpetrate any of the ſaid Offences, in form aforeſaid, which words, <hi>Any of the ſaid Offences, &amp;c.</hi> do extend to the nature of all the Offences mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the firſt and ſecond Branches: But if one forge a Writing in 37. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> and afterwards he forge another in 38. of <hi>Eliz.</hi> yet it is not Felony, although that he forgeth many Writings one after the other, for by the expreſſe words of the Act, it is not Felony. The Forgery, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which is Felony by the Act, ought to be after conviction or condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a former Writing. As to the third doubt, it was reſolved, That the allegation of the time by the Plaintiff in the Bill, ſhall not alter the Offence, but ſhall give unto the Court Iuriſdiction: but if it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to the Court, that the Forgery or Publication was after the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, then the Court ſhall ſurceaſe. As to the laſt Point, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, that the time of the Forgery is not materiall, be it before or after the Offence in truth committed, if it be committed before the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibiting of the Bill, but if the date of the Writing ſuppoſed to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, had been miſtaken, there the Defendant could not be condemned of a Deed of another date, for that is not the Offence complained of in the Bill, of which the Court can give Sentence.</p>

               <head>The Caſe of Sewers.</head>
               <p>THe Caſe was, That there was a Cawſey, or Milſtanke of Stone in the River of <hi>Dee</hi> and City of <hi>Cheſter,</hi> which Cawſey before the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, was erected for the neceſſary mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of certain Mills, ſome of the Kings, and others of the Subjects at the end of the ſaid Cawſey: and now a certain Decree was made by certain Commiſſioners of Sewers, for a breach to be made by ten Poles in length in the ſaid Cawſey, which Cawſey as it was admitted by both parties was errected before the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and ſo hath continued untill this day without any exaltation or inhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing: and if by any Decree of the Commiſſioners by force of any Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, any breach may be made in that Cawſey, was the Queſtion. And it was referred by the Letters of the Lord of the Privy Councell, to the two cheif Iuſtices, and the chief Baron; and upon hearing of Councell learned at divers daies, and good conſideration had in the time of the laſt Vacation, of all the Statutes concerning Sewers, and upon conference had amongſt themſelves, it was reſolved as followeth.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Whereas it is provided by the Statute of <hi>Magna Charta, cap.</hi> 23. <hi>Quod omnes Kidelli deponantur de cetero per Thameſiam, &amp; Medewei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am &amp; per totam Angl. niſi per Coſteram Maris.</hi> It was reſolved, That that Stat. extended only to <hi>Kidells, ſc.</hi> open Wares for taking of Fiſh; but the firſt Statute which extended to pulling down, or abating of any Mills, Mill-ſtankes, and Cawſeys, was the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 4. which Act appointed ſuch only to be thrown down or abated, which were levied or erected in the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, or after:
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:98298:21"/> But by the Statute made, <hi>An.</hi> 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. upon complaint in Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament of the great damages which have riſen by the outrageous inhan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of Mills, Mill-ſtanks, and other impediments made and erected before the Raign of King <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt: The ſaid old Mills and Mill-ſtanks were appointed by Act then made to be ſurveyed, and ſuch as were found to be much inhanſed to be corrected and amended; ſaving alwaies reaſonable ſubſtance of ſuch Mills, Mill-ſtanks Wears, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> ſo in old time made and levied: None of which Acts extended to tho Caſe in queſtion; For that Cawſey was erected before the Raign of <hi>Edward</hi> the firſt, and never exalted or inhanſed after the errection of it: And the ſtatute of 12 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 7. doth confirm all the ſaid Acts; and by them the generality of the Act of <hi>Magna Charta</hi> is reſtrained, as by the ſaid Acts appeareth. And by the ſtatute of 23 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. None of the ſaid Acts as to the Caſe in queſtion is repealed; for firſt, the ſame Act appoints the manner, form, tenor, and effect of the Commiſſion of Sewers, by which power is given to the Commiſſioners to ſurvey, Walls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Fences, Cawſeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and then to correct, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair, amend, pull down or over<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>throw, or reform, as cauſe requireth, according to their wiſdomes and diſcretions; and therein as well to ordain and do after the form, tenor, and offect of all and ſingular the Statutes and Ordinances made before the firſt of <hi>March,</hi> in the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty third year of <hi>Henry</hi> the eighth, as alſo to enquire by the Oathes of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and lawfull men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> through whoſe default the ſaid hurts and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mages have happened, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> By which it appeareth, That the diſcretion of the Commiſſioners was limited, <hi>ſcill.</hi> to proceed according to the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes and Ordinances before made, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And alſo to reform, repair, and amend the ſaid Walls, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> by force of that word (ſaid) hath relation to the precedent purview of the Act, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And further to reform, proſtrate and over-throw all ſuch Mills, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and other impediments and annoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances (aforeſaid) as ſhall be found by Inquiſition, or by your ſurvey and diſcretion to be exceſſive, <hi>i. e.</hi> hurtfull; which word (aforeſaid) refers that clauſe alſo to the precedent purview, <hi>ſcil.</hi> ſuch immpedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and annoyances as are againſt the Statutes and Ordinances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore made. Alſo it is further provided by the ſame Act, That all and every Statute, Act, and Ordinance heretofore made concerning the Premiſſes or any of them, not being contrary to this preſent Act, nor heretofore repealed, ſhall from henceforth ſtand and be good and effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuall for ever. But the ſaid Acts of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. are not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to any clauſe of that Act, nor were repealed before: And alwaies ſuch conſtruction ought to be made, that one part of the Act may agree with another, and all to ſtand together: and if they had intended a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal of the ſaid former Acts, they would not have repealed them by ſuch generall and doubtfull words, when they concerned the Inheritances of many Subjects: and according to this reſolution we certified the Lords of the Councell, that the ſaid Statutes of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. and 1. of <hi>H.</hi> 4. remained yet in force; and that the Authority given by the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sewers, did not extend to Mills, Mill-ſtanks, Cawſeys, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> errected before the Raign of King <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. unleſſe that they have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haunſed and exalted above their former height, and thereby made more prejudiciall, &amp;c. In which caſe they are not to be overthrown or ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but to be reformed by abating the exceſſe and inhaunſment only.</p>

               <head>XIV. The Caſe De Modo Decimandi, and of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitions, debated before the Kings Majeſty.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>RIchard,</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> accompanyed with the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Bathe</hi> and <hi>Wells,</hi> the Biſhop of <hi>Roche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> and divers Doctors of the Civil and Canon Law, as Dr. <hi>Dunn</hi> Iudg of the <hi>Arches,</hi> Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> Iudg of the <hi>Prerogative,</hi> Dr. <hi>James,</hi> Dr. <hi>Martin,</hi> and divers other Doctors of the Civil and Canon Law came attending upon them to the King to <hi>Whitehall</hi> the Thurſday, Fri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and Saturday after <hi>Eaſter-Term,</hi> in the <hi>Councel-Chamber;</hi> where the Cheif Iuſtice, and I my ſelf, <hi>Daniel</hi> Iudg of the <hi>Common-Pleas,</hi> and <hi>Williams</hi> Iudg of the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> by the command of the King attended alſo: where the King being aſſiſted with his Privy Councel, all ſitting at the Councel-Table, ſpake as a moſt gracious, good, and excellent Soveraign, to this effect: As I would not ſuffer any novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty or Innovations in my Courts of Iuſtice Eccleſiaſtical and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral; ſo I will not have any of the Laws, which have had judicial allowances in the times of the Kings of <hi>England</hi> before him, to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten, but to be put in execution. And for as much as upon the conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions between the Eccleſiaſtical and Temporal Courts great trouble, inconvenience and loſs may ariſe to the ſubjects of both parts, namely when the controverſie ariſeth upon the juriſdiction of my Courts of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Iuſtice; and becauſe I am the head of Iuſtice immediately under God, and knowing what hurt may grow to my Subjects of both ſides, when no private caſe, but when the Iuriſdictions of my Courts are drawn in queſtion, which in effect concerneth all my Subjects, I thought that it ſtood with the Office of a King, which God hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to me, to hear the controverſies between the Biſhops and other of his Clergy, and the Iudges of the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and to take Order, that for the good and quiet of his Subjects, that the one do not encroach upon the other, but that every of them hold themſelves with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in their natural and local juriſdiction, without encroachment or uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation the one upon the other. And he ſaid, that the onely queſtion then to be diſputed was, If a Parſon, or a Vicar of a Pariſh, ſueth one of his Pariſh in the Spiritual Court for Tythes in kinde, or Lay-fee, and the Defendant alledgeth a cuſtom or preſcription <hi>De modo Dec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>mandi,</hi> if that cuſtom or preſcription, <hi>De modo Decimandi,</hi> ſhall be tryed and determined before the Iudg Eccleſiaſtical where the Suit is begun; or a Prohibition lyeth, to try the ſame by the common Law. And the King directed, that we who were Iudges ſhould declare the reaſons and cauſes of our proceedings, and that he would hear the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorities in the Law which we had to warrant our proceedings in granting of Prohibition in caſes of <hi>Modo Decimandi.</hi> But the Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> kneeled before the King, and deſired him, that he would hear him and others who are provided to ſpeak in the caſe for the good of the Church of <hi>England:</hi> and the Archbiſhop himſelf inveigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much againſt two things: 1. That a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> ſhould be
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:98298:22"/> tryed by a Iury, becauſe that they themſelves claim more or leſs <hi>modum Decimandi;</hi> ſo as in effect they were Tryors in their own cauſe, or in the like caſes. 2. He inveighed much the precipitate and haſty Tryals by Iuries: and after him Doctor <hi>Bennet,</hi> Iudg of the <hi>Prerogative Court,</hi> made a large Invection againſt Prohibitions <hi>in Cauſis Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſticis:</hi> and that both Iuriſdictions as well Eccleſiaſtical as Temporal were derived from the King; and all that which he ſpake out of the Book which Dr. <hi>Ridley</hi> hath lately publiſhed, I omit as impertinent: and he made five Reaſons, why they ſhould try <hi>Modum Decimandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the firſt and principal Reaſon was out of the Regiſter, <hi>fo.</hi> 58. <hi>quia non eſt conſonans rationi, quod cognitio acceſſarii in Curia Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anitatis impediatur ubi cognitio Cauſae principalis ad forum Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum noſcitur pertinere.</hi> And the principal cauſe is Right of Tythes, and the Plea of <hi>Modo Decimandi</hi> ſounds in ſatisfaction of Tythes; and therefore the Conuſance of the original cauſe, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the Right of Tythes appertaining to them, the Conuſance of the bar of Tythes, which he ſaid was but the acceſſary, and as it were dependant upon it, appertained alſo to them. And whereas it is ſaid in the Biſhop of <hi>VVincheſters</hi> Caſe, in the ſecond part of my <hi>Reports,</hi> and 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. that they would not accept of any Plea in diſcharge of Tythes in the Spiritual Court, he ſaid, that they would allow ſuch Pleas in the Spiritual Court, and commonly had allowed them; and therefore he ſaid, that that was the Myſtery of iniquity founded upon a falſe and feigned foundation, and humbly deſired the reformation of that Error, for they would allow <hi>Modum Decimandi</hi> being duly proved before them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. There was great inconveniency, that Lay-men ſhould be Tryers of their own Cuſtoms, if a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> ſhould be tryed by Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors; for they ſhall be upon the matter Iurors in their own cauſe.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the cuſtom of <hi>Modo Decimandi</hi> is of Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction and Conuſance, for it is a manner of Tything, and all manner of Tything belongs to Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction: and therefore he ſaid, that the Iudges, in their Anſwer to certain Objections made by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> have confeſſed, that ſuit may be had in Spiritual Courts <hi>pro modo Decimandi;</hi> and therefore the ſame is of Eccleſiaſtical Conuſance; and by conſequence it ſhall be tryed before the Eccleſiaſtical Iudges: for if the Right of Tythes be of Eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical Conuſance, and the ſatisfaction alſo for them of the ſame Iuriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, the ſame ſhall be tryed in the Eccleſiaſtical Court.</p>
               <p n="4">4. In the Prohibitions of <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> averment is taken, That although the Plaintiff in the Prohibition offereth to prove <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum Decimandi,</hi> the Eccleſiaſtical Court doth refuſe to allow of it, which was confeſſed to be a good cauſe of Prohibition: But he ſaid, they would allow the Plea <hi>De Modo Decimandi</hi> in the Spiritual Court, and therefore <hi>ceſſante cauſa ceſſabit &amp; effectus,</hi> and no Prohibition ſhall lie in the Caſe.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He ſaid, that he can ſhew many conſultations granted in the cauſe <hi>De Modo Decimandi,</hi> and a Conſultation is of greater force then a Prohibition; for Conſultation, as the word imports, is made with the Court with conſultation and deliveration. And <hi>Bacon,</hi> Solici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor-General, being (as it is ſaid) aſſigned with the Clergy by the King, argued before the King, and in effect ſaid leſs then Doctor <hi>Bennet</hi> ſaid before: but he vouched 1 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 4. the Opinion of <hi>Huſſey,</hi> when the Original ought to begin in the Spiritual Court, and afterwards a
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:98298:22"/> thing cometh in iſſue which is tryable in our Law, yet it ſhall be tryed by their Law: As if a man ſueth for a Horſe deviſed to him, and the Defendant ſaith, that the Deviſor gave to him the ſaid Horſe, the ſame ſhall be tryed there. And the <hi>Regiſter</hi> 57 and 58. If a man be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in Expences in the Spiritual Court for laying violent hands upon a Clark, and afterwards the Defendant pays the coſts, and gets an Acquittance, and yet the Plaintiff ſueth him againſt his Acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance for the Coſts, and he obtains a Prohibition, for that Acquittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Deeds are to be determined in our Law, he ſhall have a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, becauſe that the principal belongeth to them. 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 5. Right of Tythes between two ſpiritual perſons ſhall be determined in the Eccleſiaſtical Court. And 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. where the Right of Tythes comes in debate between two ſpiritual perſons, the one claiming the Tythes as of common Right within his Pariſh, and the other claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to be diſcharged by real compoſition, the Eccleſiaſtical Court ſhall have Iuriſdiction of it.</p>
               <p>And the ſaid Iudges made humble ſuit to the King, That for as much as they perceived that the King in his Princely Wiſdom did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt Innovations and Novelties, that he would vouchſafe to ſuffer them with his gracious favor, to inform him of one Innovation and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty which they conceived would tend to the hinderance of the good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration and execution of Iuſtice within his Realm.</p>
               <p>Your Majeſty, for the great zeal which you have to Iuſtice, and for the due adminiſtration thereof, hath conſtituted and made fourteen Iudges, to whom you have committed not onely the adminiſtration of Ordinary Iuſtice of the Realm, but <hi>crimina laeſae Majeſtatis,</hi> touching your Royal perſon, for the legal proceeding: alſo in Parliament we are called by Writ, to give to your Majeſty and to the Lords of the Parliament our advice and counſel, when we are required: We two chief Iuſtices ſit in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> and are oftentimes called into the <hi>Chancery, Court of Wards,</hi> and other High Courts of Iuſtice: we in our Circuits do viſit twice in the year your Realm, and execute Iuſtice according to your Laws: and if we who are your publique Iudges receive any diminution of ſuch reverence and reſpect in our places, which our predeceſſors had, we ſhall not be able to do you ſuch acceptable ſervice as they did, without having ſuch reverence and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect as Iudges ought to have. The ſtate of this Queſtion is not <hi>in ſtatu deliberativo,</hi> but <hi>in ſtatu judiciali;</hi> it is not diſputed <hi>de bono,</hi> but <hi>de vero, non de Lege fienda, ſed de Lege lata;</hi> not to frame or deviſe new Laws, but to inform your Majeſty what your Law of <hi>England</hi> is: and therefore it was never ſeen before, that when the Queſtion is of the Law, that your Iudges of the Law have been made Diſputants with him who is inferior to them, who day by day plead before them at their ſeveral Courts at <hi>Weſtminſter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> and although we are not afraid to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute with Mr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bacon,</hi> yet this example being <hi>primae impreſſionis,</hi> and your Majeſty deteſting Novelties and innovations, we leave it to your Grace and Princely conſideration, whether your Majeſty will permit our anſwering <hi>in hoc ſtatu judiciali,</hi> upon your publique Iudges of the Realm? But in Obedience to your Majeſties command, We, with your Majeſties gracious favor, in moſt humble manner will inform your Majeſty touching the ſaid Queſtion, which we, and our predeceſſors before us, have oftentimes adjudged upon ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial proceedings in your Courts of Iuſtice at <hi>Weſtminſter:</hi> which Iudgments cannot be reverſed or examined for any Error in Law, if
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:98298:23"/> not by a Writ of Error in a more high and ſupream Court of Iuſtice, upon legal and judicial proceedings: and that is the ancient Law of <hi>England,</hi> as appeareth by the Statute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>And we being commanded to proceed, all that which was ſaid by us, the Iudges, was to this effect, That the Tryal <hi>De Modo Decimandi</hi> ought to be by the Common Law by a Iury of twelve men, it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in three manners: Firſt, by the Common Law: Secondly, by Acts of Parliament: And laſtly, by infinite judgments and judicial proceedings long times paſt without any impeachment or interrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>But firſt it is to ſee, What is a <hi>Modus Decimandi? Modus Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi</hi> is, when Lands, Tenements, or Hereditaments have been gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the Parſon and his ſucceſſors, or an annual certain ſum, or other profit, always, time out of minde, to the Parſon and his ſucceſſors, in full ſatisfaction and diſcharge of all the Tythes in kinde in ſuch a place: and ſuch manner of Tything is now confeſſed by the other party to be a good bar of Tythes in kinde.</p>
               <p n="1">I. That <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> ſhall be tryed by the Common Law, that is, that all ſatisfactions given in diſcharge of Tythes ſhall be tryed by the Common Law: and therefore put that which is the moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon caſe, That the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> preſcribes to give to the Parſon 40<hi>s.</hi> yearly, in full ſatisfaction and diſcharge of all Tythes growing and renewing within the Mannor of <hi>Dale,</hi> at the Feaſt of <hi>Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter:</hi> The Parſon ſueth the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> for his Tythes of his Mannor in kinde, and he in Bar preſcribes in manner <hi>ut ſupra:</hi> The Queſtion is, if the Lord of the Mannor of <hi>Dale</hi> may upon that have a Prohibition, for if the Prohibition lyeth, then the Spiritual Court ought not to try it; for the end of the Prohibition is, That they do not try that which belongs to the Tryal of the Common Law; the words of the Prohibition being, that they would draw the ſame <hi>ad aliud examen.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, the Law of <hi>England</hi> is divided into Common-Law, Statute-Law, and Cuſtoms of <hi>England:</hi> and therefore the Cuſtoms of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> are to be tryed by the Tryal which the Law of <hi>England</hi> doth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Preſcriptions by the Law of the Holy Church, and by the Common Law, differ in the times of limitation; and therefore Preſcriptions and Cuſtoms of <hi>England</hi> ſhall be tryed by the Common Law.

<pb n="43" facs="tcp:98298:24"/> 
                  <hi>T.

That the Statute gives that the Libel ſhall be delivered, but doth not ſay that the Plea in the Spiritual Court ſhall ſurceaſe by Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition. 2. The Statute is not intended of matter meer ſpiritual, as that caſe is, to try the Prerogative and the Liberty of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> in committing of Admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations. And there <hi>Danby</hi> Chief Iuſtice, If you will not deliver the Libel according to the Statute, you do wrong, which wrong is a temporal matter, and puniſhable at the Common Law; and therefore in this caſe the party ſhall have a ſpecial Prohibition out of this Court, reciting the matter, and the Statute aforeſaid, commanding them to ſurceaſe, until he had the Copy of the Libel delivered unto him: which caſe is a ſtronger caſe then the caſe at the Bar, for that Statute is in the Affirmative, and the ſaid Act of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. is in the Negative, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That no Suit ſhall be for any Tythes of any Land in kinde where there is <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> for that is the effect of the ſaid Act, as to that point. And always after the ſaid Act, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Term in the whole Reigns of King <hi>E.</hi> 6. Queen <hi>Mary,</hi> and Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> until this day, Prohibitions have been granted <hi>in Cauſa Modi Decimandi,</hi> and Iudgments given upon many of them, and all the ſame without queſtion made to the contrary. And accordingly all the Iudges reſolved in 7 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>Dyer</hi> 79. <hi>Et contemporanea expoſitio eſt optima &amp; fortiſſima in lege, &amp; a communi obſervantia non eſt rece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendum, &amp; minime mutanda ſunt quae certam habuerunt interpretatio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And as to the firſt Objection, That the Plea of <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is but acceſſary unto the Right of Tythes; it was reſolved, that the ſame was of no force, for three cauſes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. In this caſe, admitting that there is <hi>Modus Decimandi,</hi> then by the Cuſtom, and by the Act of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. and the other Acts, the Tythes in kinde are extinct and diſcharged; for one and the ſame Land cannot be ſubject to two manner of Tythes, but the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is all the Tythe with which the Land is chargeable: As if a Horſe or other thing valuable be given in ſatisfaction of the Duty, the Duty is extinct and gone: and it ſhall be intended, that the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> began at the firſt by real compoſition, by which the Lands were diſcharged of the Tythes, and a yearly ſum in ſatisfaction of them aſſigned to the Parſon, &amp;c. So as in this caſe there is neither Principal nor Acceſſary, but an Identity of the ſame thing.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. being a Prohibition in it ſelf, and that in the Negative, If the Eccleſiaſtical Iudg doth againſt it, a Prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition lieth, as it appeareth clearly before.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Although that the Rule be general, yet it appeareth by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter it ſelf, that a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is out of it; for there is a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibition <hi>in Cauſa Modi Decimandi,</hi> when Lands are given in ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Tythes.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond Objection, it was anſwered and reſolved, That that was from, or out of the Queſtion; for <hi>ſtatus Quaeſtionis non eſt</hi>
                  <pb n="44" facs="tcp:98298:25"/> 
                  <hi>deliberativus ſed judicialis,</hi> what was fit and convenient, but what the Law is: and yet it was ſaid, It ſhall be more inconvenient to have an Eccleſiaſtical Iudg, who is not ſworn to do Iuſtice, to give ſentence in a caſe between a man of the Clergy and a Lay-man, then for twelve men ſworn to give their Verdict upon hearing of Witneſſes <hi>viva voce,</hi> before an indifferent Iudg, who is ſworn to do Right and Iuſtice to both parties: But convenient or inconvenient is not the Queſtion: Alſo they have in the Spiritual Court ſuch infinite exceptions to Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that it is at the Will of the Iudg with which party he ſhall give his ſentence.</p>
               <p>As to the third Objection, it was anſwered and reſolved: Firſt, That <hi>ſatisfactio pecuniaria</hi> of it ſelf is Temporal: But for as much as the Parſon hath not remedy <hi>pro Modo Decimandi</hi> at the Common Law, the Parſon by force of the Acts cited before might ſue <hi>pro Modo Decimandi</hi> in the Eccleſiaſtical Court: but that doth not prove, That if he ſueth for Tythes in kinde, which are utterly extinct, and the Land diſcharged of them, that upon the Plea <hi>de Modo Decimandi,</hi> that a Prohibition ſhould not lie, for that without all queſtion appeareth by all that which before hath been ſaid, that a Prohibition doth lie. See alſo 12 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 24. <hi>b.</hi> Where the original cauſe is Spiritual, and they proceed upon a Temporal, a Prohibition lieth. See 39 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 22 <hi>E.</hi> 4. <hi>Conſultation,</hi> That Right of Tythes which is meerly Eccleſiaſtical, yet if the queſtion ariſeth of the limits of a Pariſh, a Prohibition lieth: and this caſe of the limits of a Pariſh was granted by the Lord Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor, and not denyed by the other ſide.</p>
               <p>As to the Objection, That an Averment is taken of the refuſal of the Plea <hi>de Modo Decimandi;</hi> it was anſwered and reſolved, That the ſame is of no force for divers cauſes:</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is onely to inforce the contempt.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Spiritual Court ought to have the Tryal <hi>de Modo Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi> then the refuſal of acceptance of ſuch a Plea ſhould give cauſe of Appeal, and not of Prohibition: as if an Excommunication, Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce, Hereſie, Simony, &amp;c. be pleaded there, and the Plea refuſed, the ſame gives no cauſe of Prohibition: as, if they deny any Plea, meer ſpiritual Appeal, and no Prohibition lieth.</p>
               <p n="3">3. From the begining of the Law, no Iſſue was ever taken upon the refuſal of the plea <hi>in Cauſa Modi Decimandi,</hi> nor any Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ever granted to them, becauſe they did not refuſe, but allowed the plea.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The refuſal is no part of the matter iſſuable or material in the plea; for the ſame is no part of the ſuggeſtion which onely is the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the plea: and therefore the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is proved by two Witneſſes, according to the Statute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. <hi>cap.</hi> 13. and not the refuſal, which proveth, that the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> is onely the matter of the ſuggeſtion, and not the refuſal.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the ſaid five matters of Diſcharge of Tythes mentioned in the ſaid Branch of the Act of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. being contained within a ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion, ought to be proved by two Witneſſes, and ſo have been always from the time of the making of the ſaid Act; and therefore the Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. clearly intended, that Prohibitions ſhould be granted in ſuch cauſes.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Although that they would allow <hi>bona fide de Modo Decimandi</hi> without refuſal, yet if the Parſon ſueth there for Tythes in kinde, when the <hi>Modus</hi> is proved, the ſame being expreſly prohibited by the
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:98298:25"/> Act of 2 <hi>E.</hi> 6. a Prohibition lieth, although the <hi>Modus</hi> be ſpiritual, as appeareth by the ſaid Book of 4 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 37. and other the Caſes afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid.</p>
               <p>And afterwards, in the third day of debate of this caſe before his gracious Majeſty, Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> and Dr. <hi>Martin</hi> had reſerved divers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultations granted <hi>in Cauſa Modi Decimandi,</hi> thinking that thoſe would make a great impreſſion in the Opinion of the King: and thereupon they ſaid, That Conſultations were the Iudgments of Courts had upon deliberation, whereas Prohibitions were onely granted upon ſurmiſes: And they ſhewed four Preſidents:</p>
               <p>One, where three joyntly ſued a Prohibition in the caſe of <hi>Modo De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimandi,</hi> and the Conſultation ſaith, <hi>Pro eo quod ſuggeſtio materiaque in eodem contenta minus ſufficiens in Lege exiſtit, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Another <hi>in Cauſa Modo Decimandi,</hi> to be payd to the Parſon or Vicar.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Where the Parſon ſued for Tythes in kinde, and the Defendant alledged <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> to be payd to the Vicar.</p>
               <p>The fourth, where the Parſon libelled for Tythe Wool, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendant alledged a cuſtom, to reap corn, and to make it into ſheaves, and to ſet forth the tenth ſheaf at his charges, and likewiſe of Hay, to ſever it from the nine cocks at his charge, in full ſatisfaction of the Tythes of the Corn, Hay, and Wool.</p>
               <p>To which I anſwered, and humbly deſired the Kings Majeſty to obſerve that theſe have been reſerved for the laſt, and center point of their proof: And by them your Majeſty ſhall obſerve theſe things:</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the Kings Courts do them Iuſtice, when with their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and oaths they can.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That all the ſaid Caſes are clear in the Iudgment of thoſe who are learned in the Laws, that Conſultation ought by the Law to be granted.</p>
               <p>For as unto the firſt preſident, the caſe upon their own ſhewing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth to be, Three perſons joyned in one Prohibition for three ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral parcels of Land, each of which had a ſeveral manner of Tything; and for that cauſe they could not joyn, when their intereſts were ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral; and therefore a Conſultation was granted.</p>
               <p>As to the ſecond preſident, The manner of Tything was alledged to be payd to the Parſon or Vicar, which was altogether uncertain.</p>
               <p>As to the third preſident, The <hi>Modus</hi> never came in debate, but whether the Tythes did belong to the Parſon or Vicar? which being betwixt two ſpiritual perſons, the Eccleſiaſtical Court ſhall have Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction: and therewith agreeth 38 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 6. cited before by <hi>Bacon:</hi> and alſo there the <hi>Prior</hi> was of the Order of the <hi>Ciſtertians;</hi> for if the Tythes originally belonged to the Parſon, any recompence for them ſhall not bar the Parſon.</p>
               <p>As unto the laſt preſident, the ſame was upon the matter of a Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of a <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> for Wool: for to pay the Tythe of Corn or Hay in kinde, in ſatisfaction of Corn, Hay and Wool, cannot be a ſatisfaction for the Wool; for the other two were due of common right: And all this appeareth in the Conſultations themſelves, which they ſhew, but underſtand not. To which the Biſhop of <hi>London</hi> ſaid, that the words of the Conſultation were, <hi>Quod ſuggeſtio praedicta materia<expan>
                        <am>
                           <g ref="char:abque"/>
                        </am>
                        <ex>que</ex>
                     </expan> in eadem contenta minus ſufficiens in Lege exiſtet, &amp;c.</hi> ſo as <hi>materia</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be referred to form, and therefore it ought to extend to the <hi>Modus Decimandi.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:98298:26"/>
               <p> To which I anſwered, That when the matter is inſufficiently or uncertainly alledged, the matter it ſelf faileth; for matter ought to be alledged in a good ſentence: and although the matter be in truth ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, yet if it were inſufficiently alledged, the plea wanteth matter. And the Lord Treaſurer ſaid openly to them, that he admired that they would alledg ſuch things which made more againſt them then any thing which had been ſaid. And when the King relied upon the ſaid Prohibition in the Regiſter, when Land is given in diſcharge of Tythes, the Lord Chancellor ſaid, that that was not like to this caſe; for there, by the gift of the Land in diſcharge of Tythes, the Tythes were actually diſcharged: but in the caſe <hi>De Modo Decimandi,</hi> an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual ſum is payd for the Tythes, and the Land remains charged with the Tythes, but ought to be diſcharged by plea <hi>de Modo Decimandi:</hi> All which was utterly denyed by me; for the Land was as abſolutely diſcharged of the Tythes <hi>in caſu de Modo Decimandi,</hi> when an annual ſum ought to be payd, as where Land is given: For all the Records and preſidents of Prohibition in ſuch caſes are, That ſuch a ſum had been always, &amp;c. payd <hi>in plenam contentationem, ſatisfactionem &amp; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onerationem omnium &amp; ſingularium Decimarum, &amp;c.</hi> And although that the ſum be not payd, yet the Parſon cannot ſue for Tythes in kind, but for the mony: for, as it hath been ſaid before, the Cuſtom and the ſaid Acts of Parliament (where there is a lawful manner of Tything) hath diſcharged the Lands from Tythes in kinde, and prohibited, that no ſuit ſhall be for them. And although that now (as it hath been ſaid) the Parſons, &amp;c. may ſue in the Spiritual Court <hi>pro Modo Decimandi,</hi> yet without queſtion, at the firſt, the annual payment of mony was as Temporal, as annual profits of Lands were: All which the King heard with much patience. And the Lord Chancellor anſwered not to that which I had anſwered him in, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And after that his moſt excellent Majeſty, with all his Councel, had for three days together heard the allegations on both ſides, He ſaid, That he would maintain the Law of <hi>England,</hi> and that his Iudges ſhould have as great reſpect from all his Subjects as their predeceſſors had had: And for the matter, he ſaid, That for any thing that had been ſaid on the part of the Clergy, that he was not ſatisfied: and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed us his Iudges to confer amongſt our ſelves, and that nothing be encroached upon the Eccleſiaſtical Iuriſdiction, and that they keep themſelves within their lawful Iuriſdiction, without unjuſt vexation and moleſtation done to his Subjects, and without delay or hindering of Iuſtice. And this was the end of theſe three days conſultations.</p>
               <p>And note, That Dr. <hi>Bennet</hi> in his diſcourſe inveighed much againſt the opinion in 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 14. and in my <hi>Reports</hi> in <hi>Wrights</hi> Caſe, That the Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical Iudg would not allow a <hi>Modus Decimandi;</hi> and ſaid, That that was the myſtery of iniquity, and that they would allow it. And the King asked, for what cauſe it was ſo ſaid in the ſaid Books? To which I anſwered, that it appeareth in <hi>Linwood,</hi> who was Dean of the <hi>Arches,</hi> and of profound knowledg in the Canon and Civil Law, and who wrote in the Reign of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, a little before the ſaid Caſe in 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. in his title <hi>de Decimis, cap. Quoniam propter, &amp;c. fo.</hi> 139. <hi>b. Quod Decimae ſolvantur, &amp;c. abſque ulla diminutione:</hi> and in the gloſs it is ſaid, <hi>Quod Conſuetudo de non Decimando, aut de non bene De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cimando non valet.</hi> And that being written by a great Canoniſt of <hi>England,</hi> was the cauſe of the ſaid ſaying in 8 <hi>E.</hi> 4. that they would not allow the ſaid plea <hi>de Modo Decimandi;</hi> for always the <hi>Modus</hi>
                  <pb n="47" facs="tcp:98298:26"/> 
                  <hi>Decimandi</hi> is leſſe in value then the Tithes in <hi>ſpecie,</hi> and then the ſame is againſt their Canon; <hi>Quod decimae ſolvantur abſque diminutione, &amp; quod conſuetudo de non plene Decimando non valet.</hi> And it ſeemed to the King, that that Book was a good Cauſe for them in the time of King <hi>Edward</hi> the fourth to ſay, as they had ſaid; but I ſaid, That I did not relie upon that, but upon the grounds aforeſaid, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> The common Law, Statute-Laws, and the continuall and infinite judgements and judiciall proceedings, and that if any Canon or Conſtitution be againſt the ſame, ſuch Canon and Conſtitution, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is void by the Statute of 25. <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Cap.</hi> 19. which ſee and note: For all Canons, Conſtitutions, &amp;c. againſt the Prerogative of the King, the common Laws, Statutes, or Cuſtoms of the Realm are void.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, the King ſaid; That the high Commiſſion ought not to meddle with any thing but that which is enormious and exorbitant, and cannot permit the ordinary Proces of the Eccleſiaſticall Law; and which the ſame Law cannot puniſh. And that was the cauſe of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the ſame Commiſſion, and therefore, although every offence, <hi>ex vi termini,</hi> is enormious, yet in the Statute it is to be intended of ſuch an offence, is <hi>extra omnem normam,</hi> as Hereſie, Schiſme, Inceſt, and the like great offences: For the King ſaid, That it was not reaſon that the high Commiſſion ſhould have conuſance of common offences, but to leave them to Ordinaries, <hi>ſcil.</hi> becauſe, that the party cannot have any appeal in caſe the high Commiſſon ſhall determine of it. And the King thought that two high Commiſſions, for either Province one, ſhould be ſufficient for all <hi>England,</hi> and no more.</p>

               <p>THe Attorney of the Court of Wards, moved the two chief Iuſtices and chief Baron in this Caſe, That a man ſeiſed of lands in fee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſimple, covenants for the advancement of his ſon, and of his name, and blood, and poſterity, that he will ſtand ſeiſed of them, to the uſe of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for the term of his life, and after to the uſe of his eldeſt ſonne, and to ſuch a woman which he ſhall marry, and to the heirs males of the body of the ſon, and afterwards the father dieth, and after the ſon taketh a wife and dieth; if the wife ſhall take an Eſtate for life, and the doubt was, becauſe the wife of the ſon was not within the Conſiderations, and the uſe was limited to one who was capable <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the ſon, and to another who was not capable, and therefore the ſon ſhould take an eſtate in tail executed.

               <p>And firſt it was objected, that here was no dying ſeiſed found by Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and therefore the Office ſhall be inſufficient: But as to that, it was anſwerod and reſolved, That by this Office the King was not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled by the common Law for then a dying ſeiſed, or at firſt a dying the day of his death was neceſſary: But this Office is to be maintained upon the Statute of 32 and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 8. by force of which no dying ſeiſed is requiſite, but rather the contrary, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> If the Land be (as this caſe is) conveyed to the Wife, &amp;c.

               <p>Another preſident was in <hi>Paſc.</hi> 37 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the Book of <hi>Orders, fo.</hi> 444. where the caſe was, that <hi>William Allet</hi> was ſeiſed of certain Lands in <hi>Pitſey</hi> called <hi>Lundſey,</hi> holden of the Queen in Socage in chief, and by Deed covenanted to ſtand ſeiſed to the uſe of his Wife for life, and afterwards to the uſe of <hi>Richard</hi> his younger ſon in Fee, and dyed, his Heir of full age; and all that was found by Office, and it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, <hi>ut ſupra,</hi> That no Livery or <hi>Ouſter le main</hi> ſhould be ſued in that caſe: but the doubt in the caſe at Bar was, becauſe that <hi>Henry</hi> the Feoffor had a Reverſion in Fee, which deſcended to the ſaid <hi>VVil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam</hi> his eldeſt ſon.</p>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:98298:29"/> the Statute of 13 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 5. by which it appeareth, that ſuch was the Common Law in the time of King <hi>Edw.</hi> the third, and therewith agreeth the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. and the Statute of 15 <hi>H.</hi> 2. <hi>cap.</hi> 3. That becauſe the Admirals and their Deputies encroach to themſelves divers Iuriſdictions and Franchiſes more then they ought to have, Be it enacted, that all Contracts, Pleas and Complaints, and all other things ariſing within the bodies of the Counties as well by Land as by Water, as alſo of Wreck of the Sea, the Admiral Court ſhall not have any conuſance, power, or juriſdiction, &amp;c. Nevertheleſs of the death of a man, and of Mayheme done in great Ships, being in the main ſtream of great Rivers, onely below the Bridges nigh to the Sea, and not in other places of the ſame Rivers; and to arreſt Ships in the great Flotes for the great Voyage of the King and of his Realm: and by the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 5. <hi>cap.</hi> 6. the Admirals of the King of <hi>England</hi> have done and uſed reaſonably, according to the ancient Law and Cuſtom, upon the main Sea. See the Statute of 5 <hi>Eliz. cap.</hi> 5. And all this appeareth to be by the common Law: and with that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth <hi>Stamford, fo.</hi> 51. And if a man be killed or ſlain within the Arms of the Sea, where a man may ſee from the one part of the Land to the other, the Coroner ſhall enquire of it, and not the Admiral, becauſe that the Country may well know it: and he voucheth 8 <hi>E.</hi> 2. <hi>Coron.</hi> 399. So ſaith <hi>Stamford,</hi> the ſame proves that by the common Law before the Statute of 2 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 11. the Admiral ſhall not have Iuriſdiction unleſs upon the High Sea. See <hi>Pla. Com.</hi> 37. 6. If the Marſhal holdeth Plea out of the Verge, or the Admiral within the body of the County, the ſame is voyd. See 2 <hi>R.</hi> 3. 12. 30 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 6. by <hi>Priſoit.</hi>

It was reſolved, that the ſaid Statutes are to be intended of a power to hold Plea, and not of a power to award execution, <hi>(ſcil.) de juriſdictione tenendi placiti, non de juriſdictione exequendi:</hi> For not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the ſaid Statutes, the Iudg of the Admiralty may do ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution within the body of the County: and therefore in 19 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. the caſe was, <hi>W. T.</hi> at <hi>Southwark</hi> affirmed a Plaint of Treſpaſs in the Court of Admiralty before the Steward of the Earl of <hi>Hunting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> againſt <hi>J. B.</hi> of a Treſpaſs done upon the High Sea, upon which iſſued a Citation to cite the ſaid <hi>J.

B.</hi> made default: and the uſage of the Court is, that if the Defendant maketh default, he ſhall be amerced by the diſcretion of the Steward, to the uſe of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: The which <hi>J. B.</hi> for his default aforeſaid, was amerced to twenty marks; whereupon command was made to the ſaid <hi>P.</hi> as Miniſter of the Court aforeſaid, to take the goods of the ſaid <hi>J.

               <p> In which caſe theſe points were obſerved:</p>
               <p n="1">1.

               <p>But the great Queſtion between them was, If a man committeth <note place="margin">
                     <hi>See this point reſolved</hi> 8 <hi>Eli. Dyer per curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am, which is omitted out of the printed Book.</hi>
                  </note> Piracy upon the Sea, and one knowing thereof, receiveth and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth the Defendant within the body of the County? if the Admiral and other the Commiſſioners, by force of the Act of 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 16. may proceed by Indictment and conviction againſt the Receiver and Abettor, in as much as the offence of the Acceſſary hath his begining within the body of the County?</p>
               <p>And it was reſolved by them, that ſuch a Receiver and Abettor by the common Law could not be indicted or convicted, becauſe that the common Law cannot take conuſance of the original Offence, becauſe that is done out of the Iuriſdiction of the common Law: and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, where the common Law cannot puniſh the principal, the ſame ſhall not puniſh any one as acceſſary to ſuch a principal. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Coke</hi> chief Iuſtice reported to them a Caſe which was in <hi>Suffolk</hi> in <hi>anno</hi> 28 <hi>Eliz.</hi> where <hi>Butler</hi> and others upon the Sea, next to the Town of <hi>Layſtaft</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> robbed divers of the Queens ſubjects, and ſpoyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them of their goods, which goods they brought into <hi>Norfolk;</hi> and there they were apprehended, and there brought before me, then a Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice of the Peace within the ſame County, whom I examined, and in the end they confeſſed a cruel and barbarous Piracy, and that thoſe goods which then they had with them, were part of the goods which they had robbed from the Queens ſubjects upon the High Sea: and I was of opinion, that in that caſe it could not be Felony puniſhable by the common Law, becauſe that the original act, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> the taking of them, was not any offence whereof the common Law taketh knowledg; and by conſequence, the bringing of them into a County could not make the ſame Felony puniſhable by our Law: and it is not like, where one ſtealeth goods in one County, and brings them into another, there he may be indicted of Felony in any of the Counties, becauſe that the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal act was Felony, whereof the common Law taketh knowledg: and yet notwithſtanding I committed them to the Gaol, until the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Iuſtices of Aſſiſes. And at the next Aſſiſes the Opinion of <hi>Wray</hi> chief Iuſtice, and <hi>Periam</hi> Iuſtices of Aſſiſe, was, That for as much as the common Law doth not take notice of the original Offence, the bringing of the goods ſtoln upon the Sea into a County, did not make the ſame puniſhable at the common Law: and thereupon they were committed to Sir <hi>Robert Southwell,</hi> then Vice-Admiral of the ſaid Counties: and this in effect agrees with <hi>Lacies</hi> caſe, which ſee in my <hi>Reports</hi> cited in <hi>Binghams</hi> caſe in the 2 <hi>Reports</hi> 93. and in <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtables</hi> caſe, <hi>C.</hi> 5. <hi>Reports</hi> 107.</p>
               <p>See the Piracy was Felony, the Book of 40 <hi>Aſſiſ.</hi> 25. by <hi>Schard.</hi> where a Maſter or Captain of a Ship, together with ſome Engliſhmen, robbed the Kings ſujects upon the High Seas; where he ſaith, that it was Felony in the <hi>Norman</hi> Captain, and Treaſon in the Engliſhmen his companions: and the reaſon of the ſaid caſe was, becauſe the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> were not then under the Obedience and Allegiance of the King
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:98298:30"/> of <hi>England</hi> (for King <hi>John</hi> loſt <hi>Normandy)</hi> and for that cauſe Piracy was but Felony in the <hi>Norman,</hi> but in the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who were under the Obedience and Allegiance of the King of <hi>England,</hi> the ſame was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged Treaſon, which is to be underſtood of Pettit Treaſon, which was High Treaſon before: and therefore in that caſe, the Pirates be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing apprehended, the <hi>Norman</hi> Captain was hanged, and the <hi>Engliſh</hi> men were hanged and drawn, as appeareth by the ſame Book: ſee <hi>Stamford</hi> 10.</p>
               <p>And ſome objected, and were of opinion, That Treaſons done out of the Realm might have bin determined by the common Law; but truly the ſame could not be puniſhable, but onely by the Civil Law before the Admiral, or by Act of Parliament, as all Foreign Treaſons and Felonies were by the common Law: and therefore where it is declared by the Statute of 25 <hi>E.</hi> 3. That adherence to the Enemies of the King within <hi>England,</hi> or elſewhere, is Treaſon, the ſame ſhall be tryed by the common Law: but where it is done out of the Realm, the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor ſhall not be attainted but by Parliament, until the <hi>Statute</hi> of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 2. although that there are Opinions in ſome Books to the contrary: ſee 5 <hi>R.</hi> 2. <hi>Quare impedit, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="55" facs="tcp:98298:30"/> firſt year of King <hi>James,</hi> made between him of the one part, and the ſaid <hi>John Sammes</hi> and <hi>George Sammes</hi> Son and Heir apparent of the ſaid <hi>John</hi> of the other part, did bargain, ſell, grant, enfeoff, releaſe, and confirm unto the ſaid <hi>John Sammes</hi> the ſaid Mead called <hi>Grany</hi> Mead, to have and to hold the ſaid Mead unto the ſaid <hi>John Sammes</hi> and <hi>George Sammes,</hi> and their Heirs and Aſſigns, to the onely uſe and behoof of the ſaid <hi>John Sammes</hi> and <hi>George Sammes,</hi> their Heirs and Aſſigns for ever: and by the ſame Indenture Sir <hi>Thomas</hi> did covenant with <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> to make further aſſurance to <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and their Heirs, to the uſe of them and their Heirs, and Livery and Seiſin was made and delivered according to the true intent of the ſaid Inden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the within mentioned premiſſes to the uſes within mentioned.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>John Sammes</hi> the Father dyeth, <hi>George Sammes</hi> his Son and Heir being within age, the Queſtion was, Whether <hi>George Sammes</hi> ſhould be in Ward to the King or no? And in this caſe three points were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved:</p>
               <p n="1">1. For as much as <hi>George</hi> was not named in the premiſſes, he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not take by the <hi>Habendum;</hi> and the Livery made according to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of the Indenture, doth not give any thing to <hi>George,</hi> becauſe the Indenture as to him is voyd: but although the Feoffment be good onely to <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs, yet the uſe limited to the uſe of <hi>John</hi> and <hi>George,</hi> and their Heirs, is good.</p>
               <p n="2">2. If the Eſtate had been conveyed to <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs by the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe or Confirmation, as it well may be to a Tenant by Copy of Court Roll, the uſe limited to them is good: for upon a Releaſe which creates an Eſtate, a uſe may be limited, or a Rent reſerved without queſtion; but upon a Releaſe or Confirmation, which enures by way of <hi>Mitter le droit,</hi> an uſe cannot be limited, or a Rent reſerved.</p>
               <p>But the third was of greater doubt, If in this caſe the Father and Son were Ioynt-tenants, or Tenants in common? For it was object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when the Father is onely enfeoffed to the onely uſe of him and his Son, and their Heirs in the <hi>Per,</hi> that in this caſe, they ſhall be Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants in common. By the Feoffment the Father is in by the common Law in the <hi>Per,</hi> and then the limitation of the uſe to him and his Son, and to their Heirs, cannot deveſt the Eſtate, which was veſted in him by the common Law, out of him, and veſt the Eſtate in him in the <hi>Poſt</hi> by force of the Statute, according to the limitation of the uſe: and therefore, as to one moyety, the Father ſhall be in by force of the Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the <hi>Per,</hi> and the Son, as to the other moyety, ſhall be in by force of the Statute, according to the limitation of the uſe in the <hi>Poſt,</hi> and by conſequence they ſhall be Tenants in common. But it was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and reſolved, That they were Ioynt-tenants, and that the Son in the Caſe at Bar ſhould have the ſaid Grange by the Survivor: for if at the common Law <hi>A.</hi> had been enfeoffed to the uſe of him and <hi>B.</hi> and their Heirs, although that he was onely ſeiſed of the Land, the uſe was joyntly to <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> For a uſe ſhall not be ſuſpended or extinct by a ſole ſeiſin, or joynt ſeiſin of the Land: and therefore if <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> be enfeoffed to the uſe of <hi>A.</hi> and his Heirs, and <hi>A.</hi> dyeth, the entire uſe ſhall deſcend to his Heir: as it appeareth in 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. 6. in <hi>Stoners</hi> Caſe: and by the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 10. of Vſes, it appeareth, That when ſeveral perſons are ſeiſed to the uſe of any of them, that the Eſtate ſhall be executed according to the uſe.</p>
               <p>And as to that which was ſaid, That the Eſtate of the Land which the Father hath in the Land, as to the moyetyof the uſe which he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:98298:31"/> hath, ſhall not be deveſted out of him: To that it was anſwered and reſolved, That that ſhall well be: for if a man maketh a Feoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in Fee to one, to tho uſe of him and the Heirs of his body, in this caſe, for the benefit of the iſſue, the Statute according to the limitation of the uſes, deveſts the Eſtate veſted in him by the common Law, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutes the ſame in himſelf by force of the Statute; and yet the ſame is out of the words of the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. which are, Where any perſon, &amp;c. ſtand or be ſciſed, &amp;c. to the uſe of any other perſon; and here he is ſeiſed to the uſe of himſelf: and the other clauſe is, Where divers and many perſons, &amp;c. be joyntly ſeiſed, &amp;c. to the uſe of any of them, &amp;c. and in this caſe <hi>A.</hi> is ſole ſeiſed: But the Statute of 27 <hi>H.</hi> 8. hath been always beneficially expounded, to ſatisfie the intention of the parties, which is the direction of the uſes according to the Rule of the Law. So if a man, ſeiſed of Lands in Fee-ſimple, by Deed covenant with another, that he and his Heirs will ſtand ſeiſed of the ſame Land, to the uſe of himſelf and the Heirs of his body, or unto the uſe of himſelf for life, the remainder over in Fee; in that caſe, by the operation of the Statute, the Eſtate which he hath at the common Law is deveſted, and a new Eſtate veſted in himſelf, according to the limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the uſe. And it is to be known, that an uſe of Land (which is but a pernency of the profits) is no new thing, but part of that which the owner of the Land had: and therefore, if Tenant in <hi>Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough-Engliſh,</hi> or a man ſeiſed of the part of his Mother, maketh a Feoffment to another without conſideration, the younger Son in the one caſe, and the Heir on the part of the Mother on the other, ſhall have the uſe, as they ſhould have the Land it ſelf, if no Feoffment had been made: as it is holden in 5 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 7. See 4 and 5 <hi>Phil.</hi> and <hi>Mar. Dyer</hi> 163. So if a man maketh a Feoffment unto the uſe of another in tayl, and afterwards to the uſe of his right Heirs, the Feoffor hath the Reverſion of the Land in him; for if the Donee dyeth without iſſe, the Law giveth the uſe, which was part of the Land, to him: and ſo it was reſolved, <hi>Trinity,</hi> 31 <hi>Eliz.</hi> between <hi>Fenwick</hi> and <hi>Milford</hi> in the <hi>Kings-Bench.</hi> So in 28 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>Dyer</hi> 11. the Lord <hi>Roſſes</hi> Caſe: A man ſeiſed of one Acre by Priority, and of another Acre by Poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority, and makes a Feoffment in Fee of both to his uſe: and it was adjudged, that although both paſs at one inſtant, yet the Law ſhall make a Priority of the uſes, as if it were of the Land it ſelf: which proves, that the uſe is not any new thing, for then there ſhould be no Priority in the Caſe: See 13 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>b.</hi> by <hi>Butler.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So in the Caſe at Bar, The uſe limited to the Feoffee and another, is not any new thing, but the pernancy of the old profits of the Land, which well may be limited to the Feoffee and another joyntly: But if the uſe had been onely limited to the Feoffee and his Heirs, there, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is not any limitation to another perſon, <hi>nec in praeſenti, nec in futuro,</hi> he ſhall be in by force of the Feoffment.</p>
               <p>And it was reſolved, That Ioynt-tenants might be ſeiſed to an uſe, although that they come to it at ſeveral times: as, if a man maketh a Feoffment in Fee to the uſe of himſelf, and to ſuch a woman, which he ſhall after marry, for term of their lives, or in tayl, or in fee; in this caſe, if after he marryeth a Wife, ſhe ſhall take joyntly with him, although that they take the uſe at ſeveral times, for they derive the uſe out of the ſame fountain and Freehold, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the Feoffment: See 17 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 340. So if a Diſſeiſin be had to the uſe of two, and one of them agreeth at one time, and the other at another time, they ſhall
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:98298:31"/> be Ioynt-tenants; but otherwiſe it is of Eſtates which paſs by the common Law: and therefore if a Grant be made by deed to one man for term of life, the Remainder to the right Heirs of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> in Fee, and <hi>A.</hi> hath iſſue and dyeth, and afterwards <hi>B.</hi> hath iſſue and dyeth, and then the Tenant for life dyeth; in that caſe the Heirs of <hi>A.</hi> and <hi>B.</hi> are not Ioynt-tenants, nor ſhall joyn in a <hi>Scire facias</hi> to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the Fine, 24 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Joynder in Action</hi> 10. becauſe that although the remainder be limited by one Fine, and by joynt words, yet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that by the death of <hi>A.</hi> the Remainder as unto the moyety veſted in his Heir, and by the death of <hi>B.</hi> the other moyety veſted in his Heir at ſeveral times, they cannot be Ioynt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>tenants: But in the caſe of a uſe, the Husband taketh all the uſe in the mean time; and when he marryeth, the Wife takes it by force of the Feoffment and the limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the uſe joyntly with him, for there is not any fraction and ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral veſting by parcels, as in the other caſe, and ſuch is the difference. See 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 28. And upon the whole matter it was reſolved, That becauſe in the principal caſe the Father and Son were Ioynt-tenants by the original purchaſe, that the Son having the Land by Survivor, ſhould not be in Ward: and accordingly it was ſo decreed.</p>

               <p>As to theſe points, it was anſwered and reſolved, That the Contract was not entire, but that the ſame by the Act of the Leſſor, and the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the Leſſee, might be divided and ſevered: for the Rent is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to the Reverſion, and the Reverſion is ſeverable, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence the Rent alſo: for <hi>acceſſorium ſequitur naturam ſui principalis,</hi> and that cannot be ſevered or divided by the aſſent of the Leſſee, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs attornment, or implyed by force of an Act of Parliament, to which every one is a party, as by force of the Statute of Inrolments, or of Vſes, &amp;c. And as to the two Fealties, to that the Leſſee ſhall be ſubject, although that the Rent ſhall be extinct: for Fealty is by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Law incident to the Reverſion, and to every part of it; but the Rent ſhall be divided <hi>pro rata portionis:</hi> and ſo it was adjudged.</p>
               <pb n="58" facs="tcp:98298:32"/>
               <p> And it was alſo adjudged, That although <hi>Collins</hi> cometh to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by ſeveral Conveyances, and at ſeveral times, yet he might bring an Action of Debt for the whole Rent. <hi>Hill.</hi> 43 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 243. <hi>Weſt</hi> and <hi>Laſſels</hi> Caſe: A man made a Leaſe for years of certain Lands, and afterwards deviſeth the Reverſion of two parts to one, he ſhall have two parts of the Rent; and he may have an Action of Debt for the ſame, and have Iudgment to recover. <hi>Hill.</hi> 42 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 108. in the <hi>Common-Pleas, Ewer</hi> and <hi>Moyls</hi> Caſe: The Deviſee of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of part ſhall avow for part of the Rent, and ſuch Avowry ſhall be good and maintainable.</p>
               <p>Note well theſe Caſes and Iudgments, for they are given upon great reaſon and conſideration, for otherwiſe great inconvenience would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, if by ſeverance of part of the Reverſion, the entire Rent ſhould be loſt: and the opinion reported by Serjeant <hi>Bendloes,</hi> in <hi>Hill.</hi> 6 and 7 <hi>E.</hi> 6. to the contrary, <hi>nihil valet, (ſcil.)</hi> That the Rent in ſuch caſe ſhall be loſt, becauſe that no contract can be apportioned, which is not Law: For, 1. A Rent reſerved upon a Leaſe for years is more then a Contract, for it is a Rent-ſervice. 2. It is incident to the Rever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which is ſeverable. 3. Vpon recovery of part in Waſte, or up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on entry in part for a forfeiture, or upon ſurrender of part, the Rent is apportionable.</p>
               <p n="25">25. Note; It was adjudged 19 <hi>Eliz.</hi> in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> That where one obtained a Prohibition upon Preſcription <hi>de Modo Deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandi,</hi> by payment of a certain ſum of mony at a certain day; upon which Iſſue was taken, and the Iury found the <hi>Modus Decimandi</hi> by payment of the ſaid ſum, but that it had been payd at another day: and the Caſe was well debated, and at the laſt it was reſolved, That no Conſultation ſhould be granted; for although that the day of pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be miſtaken, yet it appeareth to the Court, that no Tythes in kinde were due, for which the ſuit was in the ſpiritual Court: and the Tryal of the Cuſtom <hi>de Modo Decimandi</hi> belongeth to the Common Law, and a Conſultation ſhall not be granted where the Spiritual Court hath not Iuriſdiction of the Cauſe: <hi>Tanfield,</hi> chief Baron, hath the Report of this Caſe.</p>

               <p>SIr <hi>John Fitz</hi> and <hi>Bridget</hi> his Wife, being Tenants for life of a Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nement called <hi>Ramſhams,</hi> the remainder to Sir <hi>John Fitz</hi> in tail, the remainder to <hi>Bridget</hi> in tail, the Reverſion to Sir <hi>John</hi> and his Heirs: Sir <hi>John,</hi> and <hi>Bridget</hi> his Wife, by Indenture demiſed the ſaid Tenement to <hi>William Sprey</hi> for divers years yet to come, except all Trees of Timber, Oaks and Aſhes, and liberty to carry them away, rendering Rent, and afterwards Sir <hi>John</hi> dyed, having iſſue <hi>Mary</hi> his daughter, now the Wife of Sir <hi>Allen Percy</hi> Knight: and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſaid <hi>William Sprey</hi> demiſed the ſame Tenement to Sir <hi>Allen</hi> for ſeven years: The Queſtion was, Whether Sir <hi>Allen,</hi> having the immediate inheritance in the right of his Wife, expoctant upon the Eſtate for the life of <hi>Bridget,</hi> and alſo having the poſſeſſion by the ſaid Demiſe, might cut down the Timber Trees, Oaks, and Aſhes: And it was objected, that he might well do it: for it was reſolved in <hi>Saunders</hi> Caſe, in the fifth part of my <hi>Reports, fo.</hi> 12. That if Leſſee for years, or for life, aſſigns over his term or Eſtate unto another, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Mines, or the Trees, or the Clay, &amp;c. that the exception is voyd, becauſe that he cannot except that which he cannot lawfully take, and which doth not belong unto him by the Law. But it was anſwered and reſolved by the two chief Iuſtices, and the chief Baron, That in the Caſe at Bar, the Exception was good without queſtion, becauſe that he who hath the Inheritance, joyns in the Leaſe with the Leſſee for life. And it was further reſolved, That if Tenant for life Leaſeth for years, excepting the Timber Trees, the ſame is lawfully and wiſely done: for otherwiſe, if the Leſſee or Aſſignee cutteth down the Trees, the Tenant for life ſhould be puniſhed in Waſte<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhould not have any remedy againſt the Leſſee for years: and alſo if he demiſeth the Land without exception, he who hath the immediate Eſtate of Inheri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, by the aſſent of the Leſſee, may cut down all the Timber Trees, which when the term ended, all ſhould be waſted, and then the Tenant for life ſhould not have the Boots which the Law giveth him, nor the pawnage and other profits of the ſaid Trees, which he lawfully might take: But when Tenant for life upon his Leaſe excepteth the Trees, if they be cut down by the Leſſor, the Leſſee or Aſſignee ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare vi &amp; armis,</hi> and ſhall recover damages ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his loſs.</p>
               <p>And this caſe is not like to the ſaid caſe of <hi>Saunders,</hi> which was af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to be good Law; for there the Leſſee aſſigned over his whole intereſt, and therefore could not except the Mines, Trees, and Clay, &amp;c. which he had not but as things annexed to the Land: and therefore he could not have them when he had departed with his whole intereſt, nor he could not take them either for Reparations or otherwiſe: But when Tenant for life Leaſeth for years, except the Timber Trees, the ſame remaineth yet annexed to his Freehold, and he may command the Leſſee to take them for neceſſary Reparations of the Houſes.

               <p>THe King (in the right of his Dutchy of <hi>Lancaſter)</hi> Lord: <hi>Richard Hulm</hi> (ſeiſed of the Mannor of <hi>Male</hi> in the County of <hi>Lancaſter,</hi> holden of the King as of his Dutchy by Knights ſervice) Meſne: and <hi>Robert Male</hi> (ſeiſed of Lands in <hi>Male,</hi> holden of the Meſn as of his ſaid Mannor by Knights ſervice) Tenant. <hi>Richard Hulm</hi> dyed; after whoſe death, 31 <hi>Hen.</hi> the eight, it was found, that he dyed ſeiſed of the ſaid Menalty, and that the ſame deſcended to <hi>Edward</hi> his Son and Heir within age, and found the Tenure aforeſaid, &amp;c. And during the time that he was within age, <hi>Robert Male</hi> the Tenant dyed; after which, in <hi>anno</hi> 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. it was found by Office, That <hi>Robert Male</hi> dyed ſeiſed of the ſaid Tenancy peravail, and that the ſame deſcended to <hi>Richard</hi> his Son and Heir within age, and that the ſaid Tenancy was holden of the King, as of his ſaid Dutchy, by Knights ſervice; whereas in truth the ſame was holden of <hi>Edward Hulm,</hi> then in Ward of the King, as of his Menalty: for which the King ſeiſed the Ward of the Heir of the Tenant. And afterwards, <hi>anno quarto Jacobi Regis</hi> that now is, after the death of <hi>Richard Male,</hi> who was lineal Heir of the ſaid <hi>Robert Male,</hi> by another Office it was found, That the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> dyed ſeiſed of the ſaid Tenancy, and held the ſame of the King, as of his Dutchy, by Knights ſervice, his Heir within age: whereupon <hi>Richard Hulm,</hi> Coſin and Heir of the ſaid <hi>Richard Hulm,</hi> had preferred a Bill to be admitted to his Traverſe of the ſaid Office found in <hi>quarto Jacobi Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis:</hi> And the Queſtion was, Whether the Office found in 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. be any eſtoppel to the ſaid <hi>Hulm,</hi> to Traverſe the ſaid laſt Office? or if that the ſaid <hi>Hulm</hi> ſhould be driven firſt to Traverſe the Office of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>And it was objected, That he ought firſt to Traverſe the Office of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. as in the Caſe of 26 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 65. That if two Fines be levyed of Lands in ancient Demeſn, the Lord of whom the Land is holden ought to have a Writ of Deceit to reverſe the firſt Fine; and in that the ſecond Fine ſhall not be a Bar: And that the firſt Office ſhall ſtand as long as the ſame remains in force.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered and reſolved by the two Chief Iuſtices and the Chief Baron, and the Court of Wards, That the finding of an Office is not any eſtoppel, for that is but an enqueſt of Office, and the party grieved ſhall have a Traverſe to it, as it hath been confeſſed, and therefore without queſtion the ſame is no eſtoppel; But when an Office is found falſly, that Land is holden of the King by Knights ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice <hi>in capite,</hi> or of the King himſelf in Socage, if the Heir ſueth a general Livery, now it is holden in 46 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 12. by <hi>Mowbray</hi> and <hi>Perſey,</hi> that he ſhall not after add, that the Land is not holden of the
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:98298:34"/> King; but that is not any eſtoppel to the Heir himſelf who ſueth the Livery, and ſhall not conclude his Heir: for ſo ſaith <hi>Mowbray</hi> himſelf expreſly in 44 <hi>Aſſiſ. pl.</hi> 35. That an Eſtoppel by ſuing of Livery ſhall eſtop onely himſelf the Heir during his life: And in 1 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>b.</hi> there the caſe is put of expreſs confeſſion and ſuing of Livery by the iſſue in tayl upon a falſe Office: and there it is holden, that the Iurors upon a new <hi>Diem clauſit extremum,</hi> after the death of ſuch ſpecial Heir, are at large, according to their conſcience, to finde that the Land is not holden, &amp;c. for they are ſworn <hi>ad veritatem dicendum:</hi> and their finding is called <hi>veredictum, quaſi dictum veritatis;</hi> which reaſon alſo ſhall ſerve, when the Heir in Fee-ſimple ſueth Livery upon a falſe Office, and the Iurors after his death ought to finde according to the truth: So it is ſaid 33 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 7. by <hi>Laicon,</hi> that if two ſiſters be found Heirs, whereof the one is a Baſtard, if they joyn in a Suit of Livery, ſhe which joyneth with the Baſtard in the Livery, ſhall not alledg Baſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the other: but there is no Book that ſaith, that the Eſtoppel ſhall endure longer then during his life: and when Livery is ſued by a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Heir, the force and effect of the Livery is executed and determined by his death, and by that the Eſtoppel is expired with the death of the Heir; but that is to be intended of a general Livery: but a ſpecial Livery ſhall not conclude one: But as it is expreſſed, the words of a general Livery are; When the Heir is found of full age: <hi>Rex Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheatori, &amp;c. Scias quod cepimus homigium</hi> I. <hi>filii &amp; haeredis</hi> B. <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>functi de omnibus terris &amp; tenementis quae idem</hi> B. <hi>Pater ſuus tenuit de nobis in capite, die quo obiit, &amp; ei terras &amp; tenement. illa reddidimus, ideo tibi praecipimus, &amp;c.</hi> And when the Heir was in Ward, at his full age, the Writ of Livery ſhall ſay, <hi>Rex. &amp;c. Quia</hi> I. <hi>filius &amp; haeres</hi> B. <hi>defuncti qui de nobis tenuit in capite aetatem ſuam coram te ſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter probavit, &amp;c. Ceperimus homagium ipſius</hi> I. <hi>de omnibus terris &amp; tenementis, quae idem</hi> B. <hi>Pater ſuus tenuit de nobis in capite die quo obiit, &amp; ei terras &amp; tenement. illa reddidimus, &amp; ideo tibi praecipimus, ut ſupra, &amp;c.</hi> Which Writ is the Suit of the Heir, and therefore although that all the words of the Writ are the words of the King, as all the Writs of the King are; and although that the Livery be general, <hi>de omnibus terris &amp; tenementis de quibus</hi> B. <hi>pater</hi> I. <hi>tenuit de nobis in capite die quo obiit,</hi> without direct affirmation that any Mannor in particular is holden <hi>in capite,</hi> and notwithſtanding that the ſame is not at the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution of the Kings Writ, and no Iudgment upon it; yet becauſe the general Livery is founded upon the Office, and by the Office it was found, That divers Lands or Tenements were holden of the King <hi>in capite,</hi> for this cauſe the ſuing of the Writ ſhall conclude the Heir onely which ſueth the Livery, and after his death the Iurors in a new Writ of <hi>Diem clauſit extremum,</hi> are at large, as before is ſaid. And if that Iury finde falſly in a Tenure of the King alſo, the Lord of whom the Land is holden may traverſe that Office: Or if Land be holden of the King, &amp;c. in Socage, the Heir may traverſe the laſt Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, for by that he is grieved onely; and he ſhall not be driven to tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe the firſt Office: and when the Father ſueth Livery, and dyeth, the concluſion is executed and paſt, as before is ſaid. And note, that there is a ſpecial Livery, but that proceeds of the Grace of the King, and is not the Suit of the Heir, and the King may grant it either at full age, before <hi>aetate probanda, &amp;c.</hi> or to the Heir within age, as it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peareth in 21 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 40. And that is general, and ſhall not comprehend any Tenure, as the general Livery doth, and therefore it is not any
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:98298:34"/> eſtoppel without queſtion. And at the Common Law, a ſpecial Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very might have been granted before any Office found: but now by the Statute of 33 <hi>H<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> 22. it is provided, That no perſon or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, having Lands or Tenements above the yearly value of 20 <hi>l.</hi> ſhall have or ſue any Livery, before inquiſition or Office found, before the Eſcheator or other Commiſſion: But by an expreſs clauſe in the ſame Act, Livery may be made of the Lands and Tenements comprized or not comprized in ſuch Office; ſo that if Office be found of any parcel, it is ſufficient: And if the Land in the Office doth exceed 20 <hi>l.</hi> then the Heir may ſue a general Livery after Office thereof found, as is aforeſaid: but if the Land doth not exceed 5 <hi>l.</hi> by the year, then a general Livery may be ſued without Office by Warrant of the Maſter of the Wards, &amp;c. See 23 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 177. That the Queen <hi>ex debito Juſtitiae</hi> is not bound at this day, after the ſaid Act of 33 <hi>H:</hi> 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to grant a ſpecial Livery; but it is at her election to grant a ſpecial Livery, or to drive the Heir to a general Livery.</p>
               <p>It was alſo reſolved in this Caſe, That the Office of 35 <hi>H.</hi> 8. was not traverſable, for his own Traverſe ſhall prove, that the King had cauſe to have Wardſhip by reaſon of Ward: And when the King cometh to the poſſeſſion by a falſe Office, or other means, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of right, where in truth he hath no right, if it appeareth that the King hath any other right or intereſt to have the Land there, none ſhall traverſe the Office or Title of the King, becauſe that the Iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Traverſe is, <hi>Ideo conſideratum eſt, quod manus Domini Regis a poſſeſſione amoveantur, &amp;c.</hi> which ought not to be, when it appeareth to the Court, that the King hath right or intereſt to have the Land, and to hold the ſame accordingly: See 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>fo.</hi> 33. in the Earl of <hi>Kents</hi> Caſe, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>NOte; The Priviledg, Order, or Cuſtom of Parliament, either <note place="margin">Parliament.</note> of the Vpper Houſe, or of the Houſe of Commons, belongs to the determination or deciſion onely of the Court of Parliament: and this appeareth by two notable Preſidents:</p>
               <p>The one at the Parliament holden in the 27 year of King <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, There was a Controverſie moved in the Vpper Houſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Earls of <hi>Arundel</hi> and of <hi>Devonſhire,</hi> for their ſeats, places, and preheminences of the ſame, to be had in the Kings preſence, as well in the High Court of Parliament, as in his Councels, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: The King, by the advice of the Lords ſpiritual and temporal, committed the ſame to certain Lords of Parliament, who for that they had not leiſure to examine the ſame, it pleaſed the King, by the advice of the Lords at his Parliament, in <hi>anno</hi> 27 of his Reign, That the Iudges of the Land ſhould hear, ſee, and examine the Title, &amp;c. and to report what they conceive herein: The Iudges made report as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth; That this matter <hi>(viz.</hi> of Honor and precedency between the two Earls, Lords of Parliament) was a matter of Parliament, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Kings Highneſs, and the Lords ſpiritual and temporal in Parliament, by them to be decided and determined; yet being there ſo commanded, they ſhewed what they found upon examination, and their Opinions thereupon.</p>
               <p>Another Parliament in 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. which Parliament begun the ſixth
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:98298:35"/> of <hi>March,</hi> and after it had continued ſometime, it was prorogued until the fourteenth of <hi>February:</hi> and afterwards in <hi>Michaelmas</hi> Term, <hi>anno</hi> 31 <hi>H.</hi> 6. <hi>Thomas Thorp,</hi> the Speaker of the Commons Houſe, at the Suit of the Duke of <hi>Buckingham,</hi> was condemned in the <hi>Exchequer</hi> in 1000 <hi>l.</hi> damages for a Treſpaſs done to him: The 14 of <hi>February,</hi> the Commons moved in the Vpper Houſe, That their Speaker might be ſet at liberty, to exerciſe his place: The Lords refer this Caſe to the Iudges: and <hi>Forteſcue</hi> and <hi>Priſoit,</hi> the two chief Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtices, in the name of all the Iudges, after ſad conſideration and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture deliberation had amongſt them, anſwered and ſaid, That they ought not to anſwer to this queſtion, for it hath not been uſed aforetime, That the Iuſtices ſhould in any wiſe determine the Priviledg of this High Court of Parliament; for it is ſo high and mighty in its nature, that it may make Laws; and that that is Law, it may make no Law: and the determination and knowledg of that Priviledg belongeth to the Lords of the Parliament, and not to the Iuſtices: But as for proceedings in the lower Courts in ſuch caſes, they delivered their Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. And in 12 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 2. in Sir <hi>John Paſtons</hi> caſe, it is holden, that every Court ſhall determine and decide the Priviledges and Cuſtoms of the ſame Court, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>IN the Caſe between <hi>Heyward</hi> and Sir <hi>John Whitbroke</hi> in the <hi>Star-Chamber,</hi> the Defendant was convicted of divers Miſdemeanors, and Fine, and Impriſonment impoſed upon him, and damages to the Plaintiff: and it was moved that a ſpecial Proces might be made out of that Court to levy the ſaid damages upon the Goods and Lands of the Defendant: and it was referred to the two chief Iuſtices, whether any ſuch Proces might be made? who this Term moved the Caſe to the chief Baron, and to the other Iudges and Barons; and it was unanimouſly reſolved by them, That no ſuch Proces could or ought to be made, neither for the damages nor for the coſts given to the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: for the Court hath not any power or Iuriſdiction to do it, but onely to keep the Defendant in priſon until he pay them. For, for the Fine due to the King, the Court of <hi>Star-Chamber</hi> cannot make forth any Proces for the levying of the ſame, but they eſtreat the ſame into the <hi>Exchequer,</hi> which hath power by the Law to writ forth Proces to the Sheriff to levy the ſame.

The like Reſolution was in the Caſe of <hi>Langdale</hi> in that Court.</p>

               <p>IN a <hi>Replevin</hi> brought by <hi>John Morſe:</hi> againſt <hi>Robert Webb</hi> of the taking of two Oxen the laſt day of <hi>November</hi> in the third year of the Reign of the King that now is, in a place called the <hi>Downfield</hi> in <hi>Lud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dington</hi> in the County of <hi>Worceſter:</hi> The Defendant, as Bayliff to <hi>William Sherington,</hi> Gent. made Conuſance, becauſe that the place where is an Acre of Land which is the Freehold of the ſaid <hi>William Sherington,</hi> and for damage-feaſants, &amp;c. In Bar, of which Avowry the Plaintiff ſaid, That the ſaid Acre of Land in parcel of <hi>Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field,</hi> and that he himſelf, at the time, and before the taking, &amp;c. was and yet is ſeiſed of two yard Land, with the appurtenances, in <hi>Ludding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> aforeſaid: And that he, and all thoſe whoſe Eſtate he hath in the ſaid two yards of Land, time out of minde, &amp;c. have uſed to have Common of paſture per <hi>totam contentam,</hi> of the ſaid place called the <hi>Downfield,</hi> whereof, &amp;c. for four Beaſts called Rother Beaſts, and two Beaſts called Horſe-beaſts, and for ſixty Sheep, at certain times and ſeaſons of the year, as to the ſaid two yards Lands, with the appurtenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appertaining: and that he put in the ſaid two Oxen to uſe his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, &amp;c. And the Defendant did maintain his Avowry, and traverſed the Preſcription, upon which the parties were at iſſue, and the Iury gave a ſpecial Verdict. That before the taking, one <hi>Richard Morſe,</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the ſaid <hi>John Morſe,</hi> and now Plaintiff, whoſe Heir he is, was ſeiſed of the ſaid two yards Lands, and that the ſaid <hi>Richard Morſe, &amp;c.</hi> had the Common of Paſture for the ſaid Cattel, <hi>per totum contentum</hi> of the ſaid <hi>Downfield,</hi> in manner and form as before is alledged, and ſo ſeiſed; The ſaid <hi>Richard Morſe,</hi> in the twentieth year of Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> demiſed to <hi>William Thomas</hi> and <hi>John Fiſher</hi> divers parcels of the ſaid two yards Lands, to which, &amp;c. <hi>viz.</hi> the four Buts of arable, with the Common and intercommon to the ſame belonging, for the term of four hundred years; by force of which the ſaid <hi>William Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> and <hi>John Fiſher</hi> entered, and were poſſeſſed: and the ſaid <hi>Richard</hi> ſo ſeiſed, dyed thereof ſeiſed; by which the ſaid two yards Lands in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion and Reverſion deſcended to the ſaid <hi>John Morſe</hi> the now Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff: And if upon the whole matter, the ſaid <hi>John Morſe</hi> now hath, and at the time of the taking, &amp;c. had Common of Paſture, &amp;c. for four Beaſts called Rother Beaſts, and two Beaſts called Horſe-beaſts, and for ſixty Sheep, &amp;c. as to the ſaid two Acres of Land, with the appur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances belonging, in Law or not, the Iury prayed the advice of the Court.</p>
               <p>Note, that this Plea began <hi>Trin.</hi> 5 <hi>Jacobi, Rot.</hi> 1405. And upon
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:98298:36"/> Argument at the Bar, and at the Bench, it was reſolved by the whole Court, that it ought to be found againſt the Defendant, who had tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed the Preſcription: For although that all the two years Lands had been demiſed for years, yet the Preſcription made by the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff is true; for he is ſeiſed in his Demeſn as of Fee of the Freehold of the two yards of Land, to which, &amp;c. And without queſtion the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance and Freehold of the Common, after the years determined, is appendant to the ſaid two yard Lands; and therefore clearly the iſſue is to be found againſt the Defendant: But if he would take advantage of the matter in Law, he ought (confeſſing the Common) to have pleaded the ſaid Leaſe; but when he traverſeth the Preſcription, he cannot give the ſame in evidence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was reſolved, That if the ſaid Leaſe had been pleaded, that the Common, during the Leaſe for years, is not ſuſpended or diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged; for each of them ſhall have Common Rateable, and in ſuch man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that the Land in which, &amp;c. ſhall not be ſurcharged: and if ſo ſmall a parcel be demiſed, which will not keep one Ox, nor a Sheep, then the whole Common ſhall remain with the Leſſor, ſo always as the Land in which be not ſurcharged.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was reſolved, That Common appendant unto Land, is as much as to ſay, Common for Cattel levant and couchant upon the Land in which, &amp;c. So that by the ſeverance of part of the Land to which, &amp;c. ſo prejudice can come to the Ter-tenant in which, &amp;c.</p>

                  </gap> was affirmed for good Law: and there is no difference, when the Preſcription is for Cattel levant and couchant, and for a certain number of Cattel levant and couchant: But when the Preſcription is for Common appurtenant to Land without (alledging that it is for Cattel levant and couchant) there a certain number of the Cattel ought to be expreſſed, which are intended by the Law to be levant and cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant.</p>

                  <hi>RIchard Heydon</hi> brought an Action of Treſpaſs againſt <hi>Michael Smith</hi> and others, of breaking of his Cloſe called the <hi>Moor</hi> in <hi>Ugley</hi> in the County of <hi>Eſſex</hi> the 25 day of <hi>June</hi> in the fifth year of the King, <hi>&amp; quendam arborem ſuum ad valentiam</hi> 40 <hi>s. ibidem nuper creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cen. ſucciderunt:</hi> The Defendants ſaid, that the Cloſe is, and at the time of the Treſpaſs was the Freehold of Sir <hi>John Leventhrop</hi> Knight, &amp;c. and that the ſaid Oak was a Timber Tree of the growth of thirty years and more, and juſtifies the cutting down of the Tree by his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: The Plaintiff replyeth and ſaith, That the ſaid Cloſe, and a Houſe, and 28 Acres of Land in <hi>Ugley,</hi> are Copyhold, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel of the ſaid Mannor of <hi>Ugley, &amp;c.</hi> of which Mannor <hi>Edward Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venthrop</hi> Eſquire. Father of the ſaid Sir <hi>John Leventhrop,</hi> was ſeiſed in Fee, and granted the ſaid Houſe, Lands and Cloſe to the ſaid <hi>Richard Heydon</hi> and his Heirs by the Rod at the Will of the Lord, according to the cuſtom of the ſaid Mannor: and that within the ſaid Mannor there is ſuch a cuſtom, <hi>Quod quilibet tenens Cuſtomar. ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem Manerii ſibi, &amp; haeredibus ſuis, ad voluntatem Domini, &amp;c. a toto tempore ſupradicto uſus fuit, &amp; conſuevit ad ejus libitum amputare ramos omnimodum arborum,</hi> called Pollingers, or Husbords, <hi>ſuper terris &amp; tenem. ſuis Cuſtomar. creſcen. pro ligno combuſtibili, ad</hi> like <hi>libitum ſuum applicand. &amp; in praedicto Meſſuagio comburend.</hi> and alſo to cut down and take at their pleaſure all manner of Trees called Pollengers or Husbords, and all other Timber trees, <hi>ſuper ejuſdem Cuſtumariis ſuis creſcen.</hi> for the reparation of their Houſes built upon the ſaid Lands and cuſtomary Tenements; and alſo for Ploughbote and Cartbote: and that all Trees called Pollengers or Husbords, and all other trees at the time of the Treſpaſs aforeſaid, or hitherto growing upon the aforeſaid Lands and Tenements cuſtomary of the ſaid <hi>Richard Heydon,</hi> were not ſufficient, nor did ſerve for the neceſſary uſes aforeſaid: And that the ſaid <hi>Richard Heydon,</hi> from the time of the ſaid Grant made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, had maintained and preſerved all trees, &amp;c. growing upon the ſaid Lands and Tenements to him granted: And that after the death of the ſaid <hi>Edward Leventhrop,</hi> the ſaid Mannor deſcended to the ſaid Sir <hi>John Leventhorp:</hi> and that at the time of the Treſpaſs the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Meſſuage of the ſaid <hi>Richard Heydon</hi> was in decay, <hi>&amp; egebat ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſariis reparationibus in Maremio ejuſdem.</hi> Vpon which the Defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant did demur in Law.</p>
               <p>And this Caſe was oftentimes argued at the Bar: and now this Term it was argued at the Bench by the Iuſtices: And in this caſe theſe points were reſolved.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That the firſt part of the Cuſtom was abſurd and repugnant, <hi>ſcil. Quod quilibet tenens Cuſtomarii ejuſdem Manerii habens &amp; tenens aliqua</hi>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:98298:37"/> 
                  <hi>terras ſeu tenementa Cuſtom. &amp;c. uſus fuit amputare ramos omnimodum arborum, vocat.</hi> Pollingers, <hi>&amp;c. pro ligno combuſtabili, &amp;c. in praedicto Meſſuagio comburend.</hi> (which ought to be in the Meſſuage of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff, for no other Meſſuage is mentioned before) which is abſurd and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant, That every cuſtomary Tenant ſhould burn his Fuel in the Plaintiffs houſe: But that Branch of the Cuſtom doth not extend un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to this caſe: for the laſt part of the cuſtom, which concerneth the cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down of the Trees, concerns the point in queſtion; and ſo the firſt part of the cuſtom is not material.</p>
               <p>It was objected, That the pleading, that the Meſſuage of the Plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiff was in decay, <hi>&amp; egebat neceſſariis reparationibus in maremio ejuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem,</hi> was too general: for the Plaintiff ought to have ſhewed in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, in what the Meſſuage was in decay: as the Book is in 10 <hi>E.</hi> 4. 3. He who juſtifieth for Houſebote, &amp;c. ought to ſhew that the Houſe hath cauſe to be repaired, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>To which it was anſwered by <hi>Coke</hi> chief Iuſtice, That the ſaid Book proved the pleading in the caſe at Bar was certain enough, <hi>ſcil. Quod Meſſuagium praed. egebat neceſſariis reparationibus in maremio,</hi> without ſhewing the preciſe certainty: and therewith agrees 7 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 38. and 34 <hi>H.</hi> 6. 17.</p>
               <p n="2">2. It was alſo anſwered and reſolved, That in this caſe without queſtion it needs not to alledg more certainty, for here the Copyholder according to the cuſtom doth not take it, but the Lord of the Mannor doth cut down the Tree, and carryeth it away where the reſt was not ſufficient, and ſo preventeth the Copyholder of his benefit, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he needeth not to ſhew any decay at all, but onely for increaſing of the damages; for the Lord doth the wrong when he cutteth down the Tree which ſhould ſerve for reparations when need ſhould be.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It was reſolved, That of common Right, as a thing incident to the Grant, the Copyholder may take Houſebote, Hedgbote, and Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bote upon his Copyhold: <hi>Quia conceſſo uno conceduntur omnia ſine quibus id conſiſtere non poteſt: Et quando aliquis aliquid concedit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere videtur &amp; id ſine quo res ipſa eſſe non poteſt:</hi> and therewith a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth 9 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>Waſte</hi> 59. But the ſame may be reſtrained by cuſtom, <hi>ſcil.</hi> That the Copyholder ſhall not take it unleſs by aſſignment of the Lord or his Bayliff, &amp;c.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It was reſolved, That the Lord cannot take all the Timber Trees, but he ought to leave ſufficient for the Reparation of the Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mary houſes, and for Ploughbote, &amp;c. for otherwiſe great Depopulation will follow; <hi>ſcil.</hi> Ruine of the Houſes, and decay of Tillage and Husbandry. And it is to be underſtood, That <hi>Bote</hi> being an ancient <hi>Saxon</hi> word, hath two ſignifications; the one <hi>compenſatio criminis,</hi> as <hi>Frithbote,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, to be diſcharged from giving amends for the breach of the peace; <hi>Manbote,</hi> to be diſcharged of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends for the death of man: And ſecondly, in the latter ſignification, <hi>(ſcil.)</hi> for Reparation, as was Bridgbote, Burghbote, Caſtlebote, Parkbote, &amp;c. <hi>ſcil.</hi> Reparation of a Bridg, of a Borough, of a Caſtle, of a Park, &amp;c. And it is to be known, that <hi>Bote</hi> and <hi>Eſtovers</hi> are all one: <hi>Eſtovers</hi> are derived of this <hi>French</hi> word, <hi>Eſtouer, i. e. fovere; i. e.</hi> to keep warm, to cheriſh, to ſuſtain, to defend: And there are four kinds of <hi>Eſtovers, (ſcil.) ardendi, arandi, conſtruendi, &amp; claudendi: (ſcil.)</hi> Firebote, Houſebote, Ploughbote, and Hedgbote.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It was reſolved, That the Copyholder ſhall have a general Action of Treſpaſs againſt the Lord, <hi>Quare clauſum fregit, &amp; arborem</hi>
                  <pb n="69" facs="tcp:98298:37"/> 
                  <hi>ſuam, &amp;c. ſuccidit;</hi> for Cuſtom hath fixed it to his Eſtate againſt the Lord: and the Copyholder in this caſe hath as great an intereſt in the Timber Trees, as he hath in his Meſſuage which he holdeth by Copy: and if the Lord breaketh or deſtroyeth the Houſe, without que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Copyholder ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs againſt his Lord, <hi>Quare Domum fregit,</hi> and by the ſame Reaſon for the Timber Trees which are annexed to the Land, and which he may take for the Reparation of his Copyhold Meſſuage, and without which the Meſſuage cannot ſtand. <hi>Trinit.</hi> 40 <hi>Eliz. Rot.</hi> 37. in the <hi>Kings-Bench,</hi> between <hi>Stebbing</hi> and <hi>Groſener,</hi> The cuſtom of the Mannor of <hi>Netherhall</hi> in the County of <hi>Suffolk</hi> was, that every Copyholder might lop the Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lengers upon his Copyhold <hi>pro ligno combuſtibili, &amp;c.</hi> And the Lord of the Mannor cut down the Pollingers, being upon the Plaintiffs Copy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, upon which he brought his Action upon the caſe, becauſe that the lops of the Trees in ſuch caſe did belong to the Copyholder, and they were taken by the Lord. See <hi>Taylors</hi> caſe in the fourth part of my <hi>Reports</hi> 30 and 31. and ſee 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4 2.

That he who hath a ſpecial property of the goods at a certain time, ſhall have a general Action of Treſpaſs againſt him who hath the general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, and upon the evidence damages ſhall be mitigated; but clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the Baylee, or he who hath a ſpecial property, ſhall have a general Action of Treſpaſs againſt ſtranger, and ſhall recover all in damages, becauſe that he is chargeable over.

If a man Bayl goods which are taken out of his poſſeſſion, if the Baylee recover in Treſpaſs, the ſame ſhall be a good Bar to the Baylee: 5 <hi>H.</hi> 4. 2. In a Writ of Waſte brought againſt Tenant for life, and aſſigned the Waſte in cutting down of Trees: the Defendant pleaded in Bar, that the Plaintiff himſelf cut them: and <hi>Culpeper,</hi> the Serjeant of the Plaintiff, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt it, that it ſhould be no Plea, becauſe the Defendant had not any thing in the Freehold, no more then a meer ſtranger; and if a ſtranger had cut down the ſame Trees, he ſhould be chargeable in Waſte.</p>
               <p>Alſo in this caſe, we ſhould be at a miſchief if we ſhould not recover againſt him; for if at another time he bringeth an Action of Treſpaſs againſt us, he ſhall recover damages againſt us for the cutting, <hi>id eſt,</hi> for the value of the Trees: and yet it was holden by the Court, that the ſame was a good Bar: And it was ſaid by the Court that the Plaintiff was not at any miſchief in this caſe: for in as much as the Defendant
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:98298:38"/> ſhall have advantage now to diſcharge himſelf of Waſte againſt the Plaintiff, upon this matter he ſhall be barred for ever of his Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>ſcil.</hi> to recover the value of the Trees, which was the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief objected by <hi>Culpeper:</hi> But without queſtion he ſhall have an Action of Treſpaſs, <hi>Quare clauſum fregit,</hi> for the Entry of the Leſſor, and for the cutting of the Trees, but he ſhall not recover the value of the Trees, becauſe he is not chargeable over, but for the ſpecial loſs which he hath, <hi>ſcil.</hi> for the loſs of the Pawnage and of the ſhadow of the Trees, &amp;c. See <hi>Fitz.</hi> Treſpaſs <hi>ultimo,</hi> in the Abridgment: And afterwards, the ſame Term, Iudgment was given on the principal caſe for the Plaintiff.</p>

               <p>THe Pariſhioners of St. <hi>Alphage</hi> in <hi>Canterbury</hi> by cuſtom ought to chooſe the Pariſh-Clark, whom they choſe accordingly: The Parſon of the Pariſh, by coulor of a new Canon made at the Convoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the <gap reason="blank" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> year of the King that now is (which is not of force to take away any Cuſtom) drew the Clark before Doctor <hi>Newman,</hi> Official of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> to deprive him, upon the point of the right of Election, and for other cauſes; and upon that it was moved at the Bar to have a Prohibition: And upon the hearing of Doctor <hi>Newman</hi> and himſelf, and his Councel, a Prohibition was granted by the whole Court, becauſe the party choſen is a meer temporal man, and the means of chooſing of him, <hi>ſcil.</hi> the cuſtom, is alſo meer temporal, ſo as the Official cannot deprive him; but upon occaſion the Pariſhoners might diſplace him: And this Office is like to the Office of a Churchwarden, who although they be choſen for two years, yet for cauſe they may diſplace them, as it is holden in 26 <hi>H.</hi> 8. 5. And although that the execution of the Office concerneth Divine Service, yet the Office it ſelf is meer temporal: See 3 <hi>E.</hi> 3. <hi>Annuity</hi> 30. He who is Clark of a Pariſh is removable by the Pariſhioners: See 18 <hi>E.</hi> 3. 27: A gift in tayl was made of the Serjanty or Clarkſhip of the Church of <hi>Lincoln,</hi> and there adjudged, that the Office is temporal, and ſhall not be tryed in the Eccleſiaſtical Court, but in the Kings Court: And it is to be known, that the deprivation of a man of a temporal Office, or place, is a temporal thing, upon which no Appeal lyeth by the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. but an Aſſiſe, as in 4 <hi>Eliz. Dyer</hi> 209. The Preſident of <hi>Magdalen</hi> Colledg in <hi>Oxford</hi> was deprived of the Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter</hi> their Viſitor; He ſhall not have an Appeal to the Delegates, for the Deprivation is temporal, and not ſpiritual; but he may have an Aſſiſe: and therewith agreeth the Book of 8 <hi>Aſſ. Siracſes</hi> Caſe: But if a Dean of a Cathedral Church, of the Patron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the King, be deprived before the Commiſſioners of the King, he may appeal to the Delegates within the ſaid Act of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. For a Deanry is a ſpiritual promotion, and not temporal: and before the ſaid Act, in ſuch caſe, the Appeal was to <hi>Rome</hi> immediately. </p>
